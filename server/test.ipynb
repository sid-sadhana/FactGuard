He preferred to stay out of the limelight and projected a public image of a shy loner. Credit...Atul Loke for The New York TimesBy Jonathan KandellPublished Oct. 9, 2024Updated Oct. 10, 2024Ratan Tata, one of India’s most powerful and admired magnates, who transformed his family’s business conglomerate, the Tata Group, into a multinational corporation with globally recognizable brands, died on Wednesday in Mumbai. He was 86. The Tata Group announced his death in a statement, which did not specify a cause. Reuters reported that he had been treated in a critical care unit of a hospital.During his 21 years as chairman and chief executive, from 1991 to 2012, the Tata Group’s profits multiplied 50 times, with most revenues coming from sales abroad of such recognizable Tata products as Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles and Tetley teas.Despite the conglomerate’s international outreach, its impact at home remained greater than ever under Mr. Tata’s leadership. For middle-class Indians, it was almost impossible to get through the day without buying Tata goods and services. They awoke to Tata tea, surfed the internet with Tata Photon, watched Tata Sky programs on television, rode in Tata taxis or drove their own Tata cars, and used uncounted products made with Tata steel.Beginning in the 2010s, other family-led business groups rivaled or overtook the Tata Group in revenues and valuation. But none of the new magnates enjoyed the public esteem of Mr. Tata, who was renowned for disbursing a majority of his wealth to philanthropy and for his investments in startup businesses by young, underfinanced entrepreneurs.The unusual ownership structure of the Tata Group added to Mr. Tata’s allure. The parent company, Tata Sons Pvt. Ltd., held the majority shares and was itself two-thirds-owned by philanthropic trusts endowed by Tata family members.ImageMr. Tata as chairman of the Tata Group in 2010. During his 21-year tenure the conglomerate’s profits multiplied 50 times.Credit...Danish Siddiqui/ReutersIndia’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, called Mr. Tata “a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being” on Wednesday night, saying he had “an unwavering commitment to making our society better.”Mr. Tata preferred to stay out of the limelight and projected a public image of a shy loner, a man who never married or had children. But he became ensnared in a major controversy late in his career when he persuaded Tata’s board to oust his handpicked successor. The ensuing legal controversy took years to resolve and was a subject of constant media attention.Ratan Naval Tata was born on Dec. 28, 1937, in Bombay, now Mumbai, during the British Raj. His family belonged to the Parsi ethnic community, whose Zoroastrian ancestors fled persecution in Persia centuries ago and found refuge in India.The Tatas made their fortune in the 19th-century opium trade with China and in textile mills. By the time Ratan’s father, Naval Tata, rose to become deputy chairman of the family business, the Tata Group was entrenched in scores of manufacturing and commercial enterprises.Naval Tata married a cousin, Sooni Tata, but they separated when Ratan and his younger brother, Jimmy, were still children. Both boys were raised and adopted by their wealthy paternal grandmother.“I had a happy childhood, but as my brother and I got older, we faced a fair bit of ragging and personal discomfort because of our parents’ divorce, which in those days wasn’t as common as it is today,” Mr. Tata recalled in a three-part Facebook interview posted in 2020.He grew up in a white Baroque revival-style building in Mumbai known as Tata Palace, with a staff of 50 servants, and was driven to school in a Rolls-Royce. He was sent to the United States for high school at the Riverdale Country School in New York City. He graduated from Cornell University with an architecture degree and later took management courses at Harvard Business School.Mr. Tata maintained a subdued social life. He devoted much of his leisure time to driving sports cars, piloting planes and racing his speedboat out of the harbor near an apartment he kept in Mumbai.His survivors include his stepmother, Simone; his younger brother, Jimmy; a half brother, Noel; and two half sisters, Shireen and Deanna Jejeebhoy.Mr. Tata joined the family business in 1962. He initially worked on the shop floor of Tata Steel and then rose steadily through management positions.His single setback was at the conglomerate’s troubled electronics subsidiary, which he initially succeeded in turning around only to have it collapse during an economic slowdown. Years later, the subsidiary, Nelco, again became profitable, especially in satellite communication.In 1991, J.R.D. Tata stepped down after a half-century as chairman of Tata Sons and the Tata Group, and turned over leadership of the conglomerate to Ratan Tata, who belonged to a different branch of the Tata family.ImageMr. Tata in 2011. For middle-class Indians, it was almost impossible to get through the day without buying Tata goods and services.Credit...Carl Court/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe succession was bitterly opposed by other Tata family members and business managers. “J.R.D. got clubbed with nepotism and I was branded as the wrong choice,” Mr. Tata said in his Facebook interview.Mr. Tata quelled resistance and consolidated his leadership by forcibly retiring older Tata executives (he softened the blow with generous pensions), making subsidiaries report to the group office, and embarking on a globalization of the family businesses.He tapped into a nationalistic groundswell by pursuing a so-called reverse colonialism — the acquisition of British-based brand-name companies like Jaguar, Tetley and Corus Steel.“Britain has become an ‘insourcing’ hub for Ratan Tata: a base for foreign operations of an Indian multinational,” The Guardian wrote in a 2008 article.ImageMr. Tata in 2008 at the launch of the Tata Nano, the world’s cheapest car. It was selling for $2,200, a price within reach of the average middle-class Indian consumer.Credit...Raveendran, via Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesIn another popular move, Mr. Tata spearheaded the production in 2008 of the Tata Nano, the world’s cheapest car, with a $2,200 price within reach of the average middle-class Indian consumer.On turning 75 in 2012, Mr. Tata surrendered his executive functions in the Tata Group. In what was supposed to be a smooth transition, he appointed as his successor Cyrus Mistry, 44, whose family was the largest individual shareholder in the conglomerate.ImageMr.  Tata with his chosen successor, Cyrus Mistry, in 2012. Four years later, as tensions mounted between the two, Mr. Mistry was ousted by the Tata Group board. Credit...Vivek Prakash/ReutersInstead, the succession turned into the most high-profile corporate controversy in India’s recent history. As they had done two decades before when Ratan Tata was named the group’s successor, other Tata family and board members opposed the choice of Mr. Mistry. But with Ratan Tata’s support, Mr. Mistry won out.Over the next few years, however, tensions mounted between Mr. Mistry and Mr. Tata, who still exercised strong influence as chairman of the Tata Trusts, which controlled most of the conglomerate’s shares. Mr. Mistry divested several businesses that Mr. Tata had supported, and Mr. Tata disapproved of Mr. Mistry’s handling of the group’s international steel business and telecommunications ventures.In October 2016, less than four years after being appointed to head the Tata conglomerate, Mr. Mistry was ousted by Tata’s board with the full backing of Ratan Tata. Mr. Tata retook his position as chairman of the conglomerate until a successor was named by the board in February 2017.But Mr. Mistry did not go quietly. He sued the Tata group on the grounds that his removal was illegal. His allegations that the board fostered nepotism, ignored minority shareholders and tolerated misdeeds were given often sensational news media coverage over the next five years.Initially, the courts ruled in Mr. Mistry’s favor. But in 2021, the Supreme Court of India finally affirmed the legality of Mr. Mistry’s dismissal, ending the saga.The controversy detracted attention from Mr. Tata’s far-reaching philanthropies. In India, he disbursed much of his personal fortune on education, health and agricultural projects for poorer Indians. In the United States, he and Tata Trusts contributed millions of dollars to several universities — including his alma maters Cornell and the Harvard Business School — for research facilities and scholarship programs that carry the Tata name.ImageMr. Tata in 2022 after receiving an honorary doctorate from HSNC University in Mumbai. Credit...Punit Paranjpe/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesEnterprise and philanthropy had been at the heart of the Tata empire since its inception in 1868 by its founder, Jamsetji Tata. Jamsetji’s factories were among the first in the world to invest substantially in employee welfare, and he and his two sons left most of their estate and shares in the company to charitable trusts.Mr. Tata backed more than 50 startup companies in India, including e-commerce and digital payment platforms and an online lingerie retailer. But his favorite startup was Goodfellows, which encouraged friendships between older and younger Indians in business and other professions.At the launch of Goodfellows in Mumbai in 2022, he told an intergenerational audience, “You don’t mind getting old until you get old, and you find it’s a difficult world.”Shalini Venugopal Bhagat, Bernard Mokam and Mujib Mashal contributed reporting.A correction was made on Oct. 11, 2024: An earlier version of this obituary referred incorrectly to the Parsi community, to which Mr. Tata’s family belonged. It is an ethnic community, not a religion.When we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction.

His parents separated when he was just ten years old, and Ratan, along with his brother Jimmy, was raised by their grandmother, Lady Navajbai Tata. 2/10Ratan Tata’s EducationRatan Tata's early education took place in Bombay (now Mumbai), where he attended Campion School and later the prestigious Cathedral and John Connon School. At the age of 17, he left India to study architecture and engineering at Cornell University in New York. After completing his studies in 1962 with a degree in architecture (B.Arch), he briefly worked with Jones and Emmons, an architectural firm in Los Angeles. However, his return to India in late 1962 marked the beginning of his long journey with the Tata group.3/10Ratan Tata’s Early CareerUpon his return, Ratan Tata joined Tata Industries as an assistant and spent six months at Telco (now Tata Motors) in Jamshedpur. The following year, in 1963, he joined Tisco (now Tata Steel) as part of a training program, and by 1965, he had earned a position as a technical officer in Tisco's engineering division, showcasing his growing technical expertise.4/10Ratan Tata’s Experience in AustraliaIn the late 1960s, Tata was sent to Australia to serve as the Tata group’s resident representative, a role that broadened his exposure to global business operations. Upon his return to India in 1970, he joined Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) for a short stint before being handed his first major independent leadership role in 1971. He was named director-in-charge of National Radio and Electronics (Nelco), an ailing electronics company. Despite his best efforts, Nelco struggled financially, but the experience helped shape his leadership style and resilience.5/10Ratan Tata’s Rise in Tata SonsIn 1974, Ratan Tata joined the board of Tata Sons as a director. He was later tasked with reviving Empress Mills in 1977, another ailing Tata enterprise, which eventually closed down in 1986 due to mounting losses. During this period, he also completed the prestigious Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School in 1975, further sharpening his business acumen.6/10Ratan Tata’s Leadership DevelopmentRatan Tata’s rise to prominence continued when he was appointed chairman of Tata Industries in 1981. In this role, he focused on transforming Tata Industries into a high-technology business promoter, drafting a strategic plan for the group in 1983. From 1986 to 1989, he took on the role of chairman of Air India, gaining valuable experience in the aviation sector. His leadership style began to mature, characterised by his long-term vision and focus on innovation.7/10Ratan Tata Takes Over Tata GroupIn 1991, Ratan Tata succeeded J.R.D. Tata as chairman of Tata Sons and Tata Trusts, at a pivotal moment in India’s history. The country was beginning to liberalise its economy, and Tata initiated a restructuring process for the group, focusing on reducing its reliance on individual companies and consolidating operations. This period saw significant change, including a stronger emphasis on global expansion and innovation.8/10Ratan Tata’s Global ExpansionUnder his leadership, the Tata group entered a phase of rapid globalisation in the early 2000s. High-profile acquisitions such as Tetley in 2000, Corus in 2007, and Jaguar Land Rover in 2008 helped position the Tata group as a major global player. His ability to strategically expand the group into diverse industries, including chemicals, steel, and automobiles, was a testament to his visionary leadership and risk-taking abilities.9/10Ratan Tata’s RecognitionIn recognition of his contributions, Ratan Tata was awarded the Padma Vibhushan in 2008, India’s second-highest civilian honour. This accolade celebrated his achievements in building the Tata group into a global conglomerate, as well as his efforts in philanthropy, particularly through Tata Trusts.10/10Ratan Tata’s LegacyAfter five decades with the Tata group, Ratan Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons in December 2012. He was honoured with the title of Chairman Emeritus of Tata Sons, Tata Industries, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, and Tata Chemicals. His legacy continues to influence the Tata group and Indian industry at large, as he remains an active figure in philanthropy, mentoring, and global business leadership.Read more onRatan Tata educationRatan Tata lifeRatan Tata careerRatan Tata leadershipRatan Tata philanthropyRatan Tata achievementsRatan Tata biographyRatan Tata visionRatan Tata global expansionRatan Tata legacyPopular SlideshowsTop 5 stocks with increase in retail shareholdingGainers & Losers: HUL, Syngene among 6 stocks that hogged limelight todayGainers & Losers: Motilal Oswal, SBI Life among 7 stocks in action on FridayTop 5 equity mutual funds that gave highest return on SIP investments in 5 yearsGainers & Losers: HCL Tech, Havells India among 6 stocks in action today5 stocks with higher DII shareholding in March FY25 quarterGainers and losers: IndusInd Bank, 360 One among 4 stocks in limelight todayGainers & Losers: HUL, Syngene among 6 stocks that hogged limelight todayTop 5 stocks with increase in retail shareholding8 reasons why lucky bamboo is the ultimate indoor plantMost Popular NewsPanic and chaos in PoK after Jhelum's water surges;

ArunUPDATED: Oct 14, 2024 20:34 IST(NOTE: This article was originally published in the India Today issue dated October 21, 2024)A colossus cannot be captured in a portrait, for he carries the landscape with him. Ratan Naval Tata could not only see into the distance but also attain to the wingspan required to reach there. He was also one who dared to compose dreams on an epic scale but knew how to symphonise all the nuances to turn them into material reality. Yet he always cloaked his greatness with a rare humility and compassion. “I would like to be remembered as a person who was responsible for some change in the way we look at things,” he said in a rare interaction with the media in 2021. And then he added, “As the innovator of something that people thought was unviable and not possible.”advertisementRatan Tata, 86, who died late evening on October 9 in Mumbai following age-related illness, was all that and much, much more. He had big shoes to fill when he took over the reins of the Tata Group from the illustrious J.R.D. Tata in 1991. Ratan was in awe of JRD and shared his interests in flying and electronics. He would say later, “Jeh (JRD) was an epitome of humility. He would stand in line to check in, drive his own car. What I learnt from him and have carried with me is a sense of justice that is always prevalent. He always did the right thing irrespective of how difficult it was and stood up for principles and stood by people.”\n",
      " advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ratan Tata wasn’t clear why JRD would pick him for the top job. He was not a direct relative (Ratan was born to Naval Tata, who was adopted into the Tata family as a child, and Sooni Tata, the niece of Tata Group founder Jamsetji Tata) and was an aspiring architect after having schooled in New York’s Cornell University. He returned to India only because his grandmother, Lady Navajbai Tata, wanted him back. She was the one who brought him and his brother Jimmy up ever since their parents had separated, and she was getting old.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Two weeks after returning to India, he was sent to the Jamshedpur plant of Telco (now Tata Motors ) as an apprentice and later to Tisco (now Tata Steel) to hone his skills. He seemed to have forged his own work ethic then, rolling up his sleeves on the shop floor and sharing meals with the workers in the canteen. In retrospect, it would seem some of that steel rubbed off on him—along with the simplicity and lack of humbug from his mates.\n",

      "\n",
      "When Ratan Tata took over from JRD, it was the dawn of liberalisation in India and there were conflicting currents of enterprise and protectionism. Tata’s instinct was to venture outward, towards the global stage, rather than inward. The Tata Group was then still a loose confederation of companies, but bound by common synergies with the centre (read, Tata Sons) giving it strategic leadership. In his early years as helmsman, he laid down his motto: that the group was more important than individual companies. That meant, to unify the command structure and attain coherence of purpose, he had to sack an array of Tata satraps like Russi Mody, Ajit Kerkar and Darbari Seth who ran their own “fiefdoms”.It was also necessary to make the group nimble-footed and competitive. So, Tata sold off underperforming sectors like textiles, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and cement, and accorded a big push to software and steel and other new-age businesses. Of that phase, reminiscing to india today, Tata had these wry words to offer: “People say I am soft but yet I get accused of pushing older people out, having dark sides, selling companies and doing all those things which are not soft.”\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the group consolidation was in place, Tata executed a massive phase of expansion, straddling several key sectors. On the domestic front, he executed some audacious business plans that included the forays into telecom, retail and finance, the creation of the first indigenous car Indica, the launch of the cheapest car Nano and the re-entry of the group into aviation through tie-ups with Singapore Airlines and Malaysia’s Air Asia, among others.advertisementOn the international front, Tata aggressively acquired prized companies willing to spend big money and take huge risks. These included purchases of the UK’s Tetley Tea in 2000 for $450 million, Daewoo Commercial Vehicles in 2004 for $102 million, Singapore’s NatSteel the same year for $486 million, British steelmaker Corus in 2007 for $13 billion and the Jaguar-Land Rover from Ford Motor Company in 2008 for $2.3 billion. Some moves were more successful than the others, but what stood out consistently was the derring-do. By the time Tata stepped down in 2012, the group’s turnover that was $4 billion when he took over in 1991 had grown by 25 times and crossed $100 billion. (It now stands at $165 billion.)\n",

      "The protracted legal battle with his immediate successor Cyrus Mistry, who was sacked in 2016 following a boardroom coup, and the public battle with the Shapoorji Pallonji family, which owns 18 per cent in Tata Sons, probably was the sourest episode in his business life. Following the showdown, Tata came out of retirement to be interim chairman for a brief period before anointing Tata veteran and close confidant N. Chandrasekaran as group chairman. The Singur controversy where Tata Motors’ Nano plant had to shift its factory from West Bengal to Gujarat in 2008 following farmers’ resistance had been another tough episode. Tata then famously said, “If somebody puts a gun to my head, you either pull the trigger or you take your gun away because I will not move my head.”advertisementDespite his age, Ratan Tata remained in step with the 21st century avant-garde of business. Even a few weeks ago before his death, he was devoting a lot of his time to foster innovation at start-ups, most recently Goodfellows. In the past decade, Tata has mentored over 50 start-ups, including Lenskart, Zivame, Urban Company and Ola Electric. He continued to be chairman of Tata Trusts, the philanthropic arm of the Tatas, which holds 66 per cent stake in Tata Sons. Of late, in the winter of his life, he had also taken to sharing his past, via retro pics on Instagram. You see those same eyes, on a handsome face and rugged frame that would not have been out of place on stage in Parsi theatre—except that he never threw his voice. For, even as he strode the world of business as a titan, he dignified it with a quiet grace.advertisementSubscribe to India Today MagazinePublished By: Shyam BalasubramanianPublished On: Oct 14, 2024Trending Reel \n",

      "\t\t            Ratan Tata: Why Indians loved the business tycoonSECTIONSRatan Tata: Why Indians loved the business tycoonBy Ritika, ET OnlineLast Updated: Oct 10, 2024, 04:11:00 PM ISTRate StoryFollow usShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisRatan Tata was renowned for his transformative leadership of the Tata Group, marked by ambitious global acquisitions and ethical values. Rising from humble beginnings, he expanded the company globally. Even in retirement, Tata remained a pivotal figure, focusing on philanthropy and supporting startups while exemplifying responsible business practices.Remembering Ratan Tata: Visionary business leader who transformed Tata Group and championed philanthropyIn a nation of more than 140 crore people, there have been few businessmen with greater respect than Ratan Tata.Ratan Tata, the celebrated Indian industrialist and former chairman of Tata Sons, passed away on Wednesday at the age of 86.He stood out as a prominent business tycoon and philanthropist whose success story has profoundly impacted India’s economy. Often described as shy and a loner, Ratan Tata, one of India's most internationally-recognised business leaders, served as the chairman of 'Tata Group' for more than two decades when he retired at the age of 75 in 2012.Tata was one veteran industry leader with no massive controversy. Known for his business acumen, vision and strong work ethics, he turned his family business into an international empire. During his tenure, the group's revenues grew manifold, totalling over $100 billion in 2011-12.Also Read | Ratan Tata, the Tata Sons chairman emeritus, passes away at 86Live EventsRatan Tata: Humble beginnings and steady riseBorn in 1937 into the illustrious Tata family, Ratan Tata faced personal challenges early on, with his parents' separation at the age of 10 and subsequent upbringing by his grandmother. But this helped him inculcate resilience and a deep understanding of family values.Despite growing up in a luxurious home and with qualifications including a degree in architecture and structural engineering from Cornell University and the Harvard Advanced Management Program to his name, Ratan Tata rejected a job offer from IBM. He started working on the shop floor of Telco (now Tata Motors) in 1962 where he shoveled limestone and was a team member in the blast furnaces.Also Read: How Ratan Tata impacted millions beyond the boardroomHe built his career from the ground up, worked with different companies within the Tata Group and eventually became the director of National Radio and Electronics (NELCO) in 1971. It took him nine years to move from an apprentice to a director but he never shied away from working hard, showing unwavering commitment and dedication to understand the on-ground realities and nuances of the common man. He steadily rose through the ranks, honing his skills and gaining invaluable experience in diverse industries across the group.“Our grandmother taught us to retain dignity at all costs, a value that’s stayed with me until today.” – Ratan TataRatan Tata: The Risk TakerTake a look anywhere in India - there's one brand you will find almost everywhere - Tata. It would be hard to find a person in the country who has not used a Tata product or service. From Tata salt to Tata Motors - you name it, they have it. Tata is perhaps India's most ubiquitous brand.But this journey was far from easy. Despite odds, Ratan Tata showed rare courage and pulled off big acquisitions.In 1991, when Ratan Tata took over from JRD Tata as Chairman of Tata Sons and Chairman of the Tata trusts, he began restructuring of the Tata group at a time when the Indian economic liberalisation was under way.Also Read | Ratan Tata passes away at 86; meet his successors, the next-gen Tata scionsThe growth and globalisation drive of the Tata group gathered pace under his stewardship and the new millennium saw a string of high-profile Tata acquisitions. Among them were Tetley for $431.3 million, Corus for $11.3 billion, Jaguar Land Rover for $2.3 billion, Brunner Mond, General Chemical Industrial Products and Daewoo for $102 million.These daring moves under Ratan Tata's astute leadership helped the Tata group to expand its global footprint, reaching over 100 countries, thus giving a significant boost to the Indian industrial sector. He has been credited with turning Tata from a largely India-centric company into a global business.The company also bought hotels, chemical companies, communications networks and energy providers around the world.Moreover, the returning of Air India back into the Tata fold was widely seen as a way of honouring his forefathers, as it was founded by his uncle and mentor Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata in 1932.\"The biggest risk is not taking any risk. In a world that is changing quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks.\"Ratan Tata’s Mass connectYou can hardly cross a street in India without seeing a Tata truck, bus or SUV.Ratan Tata tapped into the pulse of the Indian market to understand people's needs and daily lives. He led initiatives like the Tata Nano, world's cheapest car designed for affordability and mass mobility, and not to forget Tata Indica, a pioneering attempt at creating a truly Indian car.“I remember seeing a family of four on a motorbike in the heavy Bombay rain — I knew I wanted to do more for these families who were risking their lives for lack of an alternative,\" Tata had recalled, giving the reason why he decided to come up with Tata Nano. This reflected Ratan Tata's unwavering belief in empowering the common man.\"The greatest pleasure I've had is trying to do something, everybody says 'could not be done.'\"- Ratan TataRatan Tata: A Lifetime of givingRatan Tata's vision extended beyond profit. He was deeply committed to social responsibility and sustainability. Ratan Tata ranked 433 in the IIFL Wealth Hurun India Rich List 2021. This perhaps was because he was also one of the most generous philanthropists.His foundation Tata Trusts, one of India's largest charitable organisations, has built technology centres to provide scholarships to students and support projects related to healthcare, education, rural development and sustainable living. He also donated Rs 500 crore when the world was fighting the deadly pandemic, a move that earned him numerous praises.Ratan Tata also donated $50 million to his alma mater, Harvard Business School for building an executive center. The Tata Trusts have financed many educational institutes such as the Indian Institute of Science and various IIM campuses.In the aftermath of the deadly 26/11 attacks in Mumbai, Ratan Tata set up the ‘Taj public Service Welfare Trust’ to help the victims and their families get rehabilitated.The visionary industrialist also invested in a startup that connects senior citizens with young graduates for meaningful friendships. He had backed over 50 startups including eyewear retailer Lenskart, digital payments brand Paytm, electric vehicle startup Ola Electric Mobility and online stock trading platform Upstox.His love for dogs needs no introduction. Tata Sons' global headquarters at Bombay House is home to several strays who are looked after by the group.Ratan Tata also found his assistant Shantanu Naidu through their mutual love for dogs. Naidu connected with Tata when he sought funding for his first startup, Motopaws, a social enterprise that provided reflective collars for street dogs.In 2021, social media users were full of praise for Ratan Tata when he travelled from Mumbai to Pune to visit a former employee who had been unwell for two years.The government recognised his contributions to the industry and society and awarded him with Padma Bhushan in 2000 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2008, both of which are among India's highest civilian awards. He had also received honorary doctorates from several universities in India and overseas.A revered figure in India, Ratan Tata's unpralled legacy is multi-faceted.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)( Originally published on Oct 09, 2024 )In Video: \n",

      "Ratan TataRatan Naval Tata, one of India’s most revered industrialists and a paragon of leadership, passed away at the age of 86. His demise marks the close of a remarkable chapter in the annals of global business. A towering figure in Indian industry, Tata was a man of quiet dignity, profound foresight, and a deep-rooted sense of social responsibility.Here are Ratan Tata's Key Achievements: A storied beginningBorn in Mumbai (then Bombay) on December 28, 1937, into the illustrious Tata family, Ratan Tata was destined for a life of significance. Yet, his rise to prominence was never one of mere inheritance. Raised by his grandmother, Lady Navajbai Tata, in the aftermath of his parents’ separation, Tata grew up with an understated sense of duty that would shape his approach to life and business.\n",

      "He was educated at the Cathedral and John Connon School in Mumbai before journeying abroad to complete his degree in architecture from Cornell University in 1962. It was here that Tata first developed a passion for design—an inclination that would later influence some of his most iconic business ventures. He further honed his managerial acumen at Harvard Business School, completing the Advanced Management Program in 1975.A reluctant leader who transformed the Tata GroupRatan Tata’s early years at the Tata Group were characterised by a deliberate avoidance of any overt reliance on his family name. He began his career on the shop floor at Tata Steel, where he worked alongside blue-collar laborers, learning the business from the ground up. This humility and hands-on experience would define his approach to leadership in the years to come.When Tata assumed leadership of the Tata Group in 1991, he inherited an empire steeped in legacy but in need of reinvention. What followed was nothing short of a corporate renaissance. During his two-decade tenure as chairman, Tata transformed the sprawling conglomerate from a predominantly India-focused entity into a global enterprise. Under his stewardship, the Group expanded into over 100 countries, with nearly two-thirds of its revenue generated from outside India.Key achievementsAmong Tata’s most notable accomplishments were his bold acquisitions of international brands, a testament to his vision of making the Tata Group a global player. The acquisition of Tetley Tea in 2000 marked the first significant overseas purchase by an Indian company, setting the tone for what was to come. The group went on to acquire the UK’s Corus Steel in 2007 and the iconic Jaguar Land Rover in 2008, moves that were initially met with skepticism but ultimately underscored Tata’s far-reaching foresight.\n",

      "One of Tata’s most audacious initiatives, however, was the Tata Nano—a car designed to offer mobility to the masses at an affordable price. Launched in 2008, the Nano was a manifestation of Tata’s belief that business must serve society. While commercially less successful than anticipated, the project nonetheless earned Tata international recognition as a visionary entrepreneur who sought to bridge the gap between aspiration and accessibility.A life of philanthropy and purposeBeyond business, Ratan Tata was deeply committed to philanthropy, a legacy that traces its roots to the founding principles of the Tata family. As chairman of the Tata Trusts—one of India’s oldest and most significant charitable organizations—he oversaw substantial investments in areas such as healthcare, education, and rural development. His personal dedication to these causes extended beyond mere financial contributions; Tata was an advocate for using wealth as a tool for societal improvement, often working quietly behind the scenes to advance causes close to his heart.His philanthropic endeavors were as transformative as his business successes. Tata was instrumental in the establishment of numerous educational institutions, scholarships, and healthcare initiatives, helping countless individuals across the country. His legacy in this regard is profound—ensuring that the fruits of his success were shared widely and meaningfully.Controversies and challengesWhile Ratan Tata was lauded for his integrity and vision, his journey was not without its share of challenges and controversies. The acquisition of Corus Steel, though eventually successful, was heavily criticised for its timing and cost, particularly as the global economy began to falter soon after. The Tata Nano project, though groundbreaking in its ambition, faced several production delays and did not live up to its commercial promise, prompting some to question whether it was ahead of its time.The most public controversy of Tata’s career came in 2016, when his successor, Cyrus Mistry, was ousted as chairman of Tata Sons. The legal battle that ensued raised questions about governance within the group, putting Tata in the unfamiliar position of being at the center of public scrutiny. Yet, through it all, Tata maintained a characteristic stoicism, choosing to defend the values and ethics of the group while refraining from descending into personal attacks.A legacy of grace and dignityPerhaps the most defining trait of Ratan Tata’s leadership was his unwavering adherence to ethical principles. In an era marked by corporate greed and misconduct, Tata was a beacon of integrity. He famously declined a bribe when his company was bidding to start an airline, underscoring his belief that profits should never come at the expense of one’s principles.Tata’s retirement in 2012 marked the end of an era for the conglomerate, but his influence remained palpable. He continued to mentor young entrepreneurs, offering guidance and support to India’s burgeoning startup ecosystem. His investment in several Indian startups—including Ola and Paytm—demonstrated his continued belief in the power of innovation to drive progress. Tata leaves behind a legacy that transcends the corporate world. His vision, compassion, and relentless pursuit of excellence have left an indelible mark on India and the world. His life is a testament to the belief that business, when conducted with integrity, can be a force for good. \n",

This hands-on experience gave him a unique understanding of the people who powered India's industrial growth.Transforming Tata GroupRatan Tata took over as Chairman of Tata Sons in 1991, succeeding JRD Tata. At that time, the Tata Group was largely an Indian conglomerate with annual revenues of around $5 billion.Under his visionary leadership, the Group expanded to over $100 billion in revenue by the time he retired in 2012. Today, the Tata Group operates in over 100 countries, with a strong presence in industries, ranging from steel and automobiles to IT services and consumer goods.Iconic acquisitions and global expansionadvertisementRatan Tata's approach was bold, steering the Tata Group toward becoming a global powerhouse. His philosophy of putting India and its people first was evident in how he leveraged international acquisitions to bolster the country's image on the global stage.Tetley (2000): The acquisition of the British tea giant for $450 million was one of the first major overseas purchases by an Indian company. It marked Tata's entry into the global beverage market.Corus (2007): Tata Steel's $13 billion acquisition of Corus made Tata one of the world's largest steel producers.Jaguar Land Rover (2008): Ratan Tata transformed Tata Motors into a global automotive player with the $2.3 billion acquisition of these iconic British car brands. This deal not only turned Tata Motors into a global competitor but also resurrected the luxury car brands.'India and Indians First': The Tata NanoPerhaps no other project better symbolized Ratan Tata's commitment to India than the Tata Nano, launched in 2008.His vision was to create the world's cheapest car, priced at Rs 1 lakh, to provide affordable mobility for the Indian middle class. Though the car didn't achieve commercial success, the sentiment behind the Nano was a testament to Tata's people-centric leadership. It reflected his desire to improve the lives of millions of Indians through innovation.Navigating crises with graceadvertisementRatan Tata’s leadership shone through during times of adversity. The 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks shook India, and one of the primary targets was the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, part of the Tata Group.Ratan Tata was at the forefront of the recovery efforts, ensuring that the Taj was rebuilt stronger than ever. His compassion toward the victims and employees of the attacks further underscored his commitment to people and ethics.Awards and recognitionRatan Tata’s contributions to business, philanthropy, and the nation earned him numerous accolades and awards, both domestically and internationally:\n",

In 2007, he became the first Indian to fly an F-16 Falcon-a symbolic moment highlighting his adventurous spirit and his love for aviation.He was also deeply involved in the Tata Group's philanthropic arm, the Tata Trusts, which contributes to sectors like education, healthcare, and rural development. Throughout his career, Ratan Tata ensured that the Group's wealth served the nation, with 60-65% of Tata Sons' dividends directed to charitable causes.Ratan Tata's legacy extends far beyond the companies he built.

He was 86.Tata, who ran the conglomerate for more than 20 years as chairman, had been undergoing intensive care in a Mumbai hospital, two sources with direct knowledge of his medical situation told Reuters earlier on Wednesday. Sign up  here.\"It is with a profound sense of loss that we bid farewell to Mr. Ratan Naval Tata, a truly uncommon leader whose immeasurable contributions have shaped not only the Tata Group but also the very fabric of our nation,\" the company said.Ratan Tata \"was a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being,\" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on social media platform X. \"Extremely pained by his passing away. My thoughts are with his family, friends and admirers in this sad hour.\"After graduating with a degree in architecture at Cornell University, he returned to India and in 1962 began working for the group his great-grandfather had founded nearly a century earlier.He worked in several Tata companies, including Telco, now Tata Motors Ltd (TAMO.NS), opens new tab, as well as Tata Steel Ltd (TISC.NS), opens new tab, later making his mark by erasing losses and increasing market share at group unit National Radio & Electronics Company.In 1991, he took the helm of the conglomerate when his uncle J.R.D. Tata stepped down - the passing of the baton coming just as India embarked on radical reforms that opened up its economy to the world and ushered in an era of high growth.In one of his first steps, Ratan Tata sought to rein in the power of some heads of Tata Group's companies, enforcing retirement ages, promoting younger people to senior positions and ramping up control over companies.He founded telecommunications firm Tata Teleservices (TTML.NS), opens new tab in 1996 and took IT firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS.NS), opens new tab, the group's cash cow, public in 2004.But to grow properly, the group determined it needed to look beyond Indian shores.Item 1 of 10 Ratan Tata, chairman of Tata Motors Ltd, poses with company's new estate version Indigo 'Marina' car, during its launch in Bombay September 15, 2004. REUTERS/Punit Paranjpe/File photo[1/10]Ratan Tata, chairman of Tata Motors Ltd, poses with company's new estate version Indigo 'Marina' car, during its launch in Bombay September 15, 2004. REUTERS/Punit Paranjpe/File photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tabIt \"was the quest for growth and changing the ground rules to say that we could grow by acquisitions which earlier we had never done,\" he said in an interview with the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 2013.The group purchased British tea firm Tetley in 2000 for $432 million and Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus in 2007 for $13 billion, at the time the biggest takeover of a foreign firm by an Indian company. Tata Motors then acquired British luxury auto brands Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford Motor Co (F.N), opens new tab in 2008 for $2.3 billion.His pet projects at Tata Motors included the Indica - the first car model designed and built in India - as well as the Nano, touted as the world's cheapest car. He contributed initial sketches for both models.The Indica was a commercial success. The Nano, however, priced at just 100,000 rupees (about $1,200) and the culmination of Ratan Tata's dream to produce an affordable car for India's masses, was hurt by initial safety issues and bungled marketing. It was discontinued a decade after its launch.A licensed pilot who would occasionally fly the company plane, Ratan Tata never married and was known for his quiet demeanour, relatively modest lifestyle and philanthropic work.About two-thirds of share capital of Tata Sons, the group's holding company, is held by philanthropic trusts.His leadership at Tata was not without controversy - most notably a bitter public feud after the company ousted Cyrus Mistry, a scion of the billionaire Shapoorji Pallonji clan, as chairman of Tata Sons in 2016.The Tata Group said Mistry had failed to turnaround poorly performing businesses while Mistry accused Ratan Tata, who was chairman emeritus of the conglomerate, of interfering and creating an alternate power centre at the group.After he stepped back from the Tata Group, Ratan Tata became known as a prominent investor in Indian startups, backing a plethora of companies including digital payments firm Paytm (PAYT.NS), opens new tab, Ola Electric, a unit of ride hailing firm Ola, and home and beauty services provider Urban Company.Among his many awards, he received the Padma Vibhushan, India's second highest civilian honour, in 2008 for exceptional and distinguished service in trade and industry.($1 = 83.9330 Indian rupees)Reporting by Abhirup Roy in San Francisco; additional reporting by Gursimran Kaur; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Rosalba O'BrienOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tabSuggested Topics:IndiaADAS, AV & SafetySoftware-Defined VehicleRetailBoardsShareXFacebookLinkedinEmailLinkPurchase Licensing RightsRead NextAsia PacificcategoryPanic in Pakistan as India vows to cut off water supply over Kashmir9:10 AM UTCIndiacategoryPakistan calls for neutral probe into Kashmir attack India blames it forApril 26, 2025IndiacategoryIndia’s IndusInd Bank to take $230 million hit in 2024-25 accounts3:59 PM UTCWorldcategoryPakistan minister urges international probe of Kashmir attack, NYT reportsApril 25, 2025WorldTrump officials push Russia-Ukraine peace deal after Vatican meetingWorldcategory · April 27, 2025 · 7:14 PM UTC ·  agoSecretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. would consider in the coming week whether to continue mediating talks \"or if it's time to sort of focus on some other issues.\"EuropecategoryMore than 30,000 people pack Rome church to visit Pope Francis' tomb7:14 PM UTC · Updated  agoAmericascategoryPolice arrest 30-year-old man in Vancouver car attack6:46 PM UTC · Updated  agoAmericascategoryEcuador opposition objects to election results after being denied recount6:43 PM UTC · Updated  agoAmericascategoryVancouver car attack latest: Police say 11 people have died after a man drove into festival crowd7:21 PM UTC · Updated  agoSite IndexBrowseWorldBusinessMarketsSustainabilityLegalBreakingviewsTechnologyInvestigationsSportsScienceLifestyleAbout ReutersAbout Reuters, opens new tabAdvertise with Us, opens new tabCareers, opens new tabReuters News Agency, opens new tabBrand Attribution Guidelines, opens new tabReuters and AI, opens new tabReuters Leadership, opens new tabReuters Fact CheckReuters Diversity Report, opens new tabStay InformedDownload the App (iOS), opens new tabDownload the App (Android), opens new tabNewslettersInformation you can trustReuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

He preferred to stay out of the limelight and projected a public image of a shy loner. Credit...Atul Loke for The New York TimesBy Jonathan KandellPublished Oct. 9, 2024Updated Oct. 10, 2024Ratan Tata, one of India’s most powerful and admired magnates, who transformed his family’s business conglomerate, the Tata Group, into a multinational corporation with globally recognizable brands, died on Wednesday in Mumbai. He was 86. The Tata Group announced his death in a statement, which did not specify a cause. Reuters reported that he had been treated in a critical care unit of a hospital.During his 21 years as chairman and chief executive, from 1991 to 2012, the Tata Group’s profits multiplied 50 times, with most revenues coming from sales abroad of such recognizable Tata products as Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles and Tetley teas.Despite the conglomerate’s international outreach, its impact at home remained greater than ever under Mr. Tata’s leadership. For middle-class Indians, it was almost impossible to get through the day without buying Tata goods and services. They awoke to Tata tea, surfed the internet with Tata Photon, watched Tata Sky programs on television, rode in Tata taxis or drove their own Tata cars, and used uncounted products made with Tata steel.Beginning in the 2010s, other family-led business groups rivaled or overtook the Tata Group in revenues and valuation. But none of the new magnates enjoyed the public esteem of Mr. Tata, who was renowned for disbursing a majority of his wealth to philanthropy and for his investments in startup businesses by young, underfinanced entrepreneurs.The unusual ownership structure of the Tata Group added to Mr. Tata’s allure. The parent company, Tata Sons Pvt. Ltd., held the majority shares and was itself two-thirds-owned by philanthropic trusts endowed by Tata family members.ImageMr. Tata as chairman of the Tata Group in 2010. During his 21-year tenure the conglomerate’s profits multiplied 50 times.Credit...Danish Siddiqui/ReutersIndia’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, called Mr. Tata “a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being” on Wednesday night, saying he had “an unwavering commitment to making our society better.”Mr. Tata preferred to stay out of the limelight and projected a public image of a shy loner, a man who never married or had children. But he became ensnared in a major controversy late in his career when he persuaded Tata’s board to oust his handpicked successor. The ensuing legal controversy took years to resolve and was a subject of constant media attention.Ratan Naval Tata was born on Dec. 28, 1937, in Bombay, now Mumbai, during the British Raj. His family belonged to the Parsi ethnic community, whose Zoroastrian ancestors fled persecution in Persia centuries ago and found refuge in India.The Tatas made their fortune in the 19th-century opium trade with China and in textile mills. By the time Ratan’s father, Naval Tata, rose to become deputy chairman of the family business, the Tata Group was entrenched in scores of manufacturing and commercial enterprises.Naval Tata married a cousin, Sooni Tata, but they separated when Ratan and his younger brother, Jimmy, were still children. Both boys were raised and adopted by their wealthy paternal grandmother.“I had a happy childhood, but as my brother and I got older, we faced a fair bit of ragging and personal discomfort because of our parents’ divorce, which in those days wasn’t as common as it is today,” Mr. Tata recalled in a three-part Facebook interview posted in 2020.He grew up in a white Baroque revival-style building in Mumbai known as Tata Palace, with a staff of 50 servants, and was driven to school in a Rolls-Royce. He was sent to the United States for high school at the Riverdale Country School in New York City. He graduated from Cornell University with an architecture degree and later took management courses at Harvard Business School.Mr. Tata maintained a subdued social life. He devoted much of his leisure time to driving sports cars, piloting planes and racing his speedboat out of the harbor near an apartment he kept in Mumbai.His survivors include his stepmother, Simone; his younger brother, Jimmy; a half brother, Noel; and two half sisters, Shireen and Deanna Jejeebhoy.Mr. Tata joined the family business in 1962. He initially worked on the shop floor of Tata Steel and then rose steadily through management positions.His single setback was at the conglomerate’s troubled electronics subsidiary, which he initially succeeded in turning around only to have it collapse during an economic slowdown. Years later, the subsidiary, Nelco, again became profitable, especially in satellite communication.In 1991, J.R.D. Tata stepped down after a half-century as chairman of Tata Sons and the Tata Group, and turned over leadership of the conglomerate to Ratan Tata, who belonged to a different branch of the Tata family.ImageMr. Tata in 2011. For middle-class Indians, it was almost impossible to get through the day without buying Tata goods and services.Credit...Carl Court/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe succession was bitterly opposed by other Tata family members and business managers. “J.R.D. got clubbed with nepotism and I was branded as the wrong choice,” Mr. Tata said in his Facebook interview.Mr. Tata quelled resistance and consolidated his leadership by forcibly retiring older Tata executives (he softened the blow with generous pensions), making subsidiaries report to the group office, and embarking on a globalization of the family businesses.He tapped into a nationalistic groundswell by pursuing a so-called reverse colonialism — the acquisition of British-based brand-name companies like Jaguar, Tetley and Corus Steel.“Britain has become an ‘insourcing’ hub for Ratan Tata: a base for foreign operations of an Indian multinational,” The Guardian wrote in a 2008 article.ImageMr. Tata in 2008 at the launch of the Tata Nano, the world’s cheapest car. It was selling for $2,200, a price within reach of the average middle-class Indian consumer.Credit...Raveendran, via Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesIn another popular move, Mr. Tata spearheaded the production in 2008 of the Tata Nano, the world’s cheapest car, with a $2,200 price within reach of the average middle-class Indian consumer.On turning 75 in 2012, Mr. Tata surrendered his executive functions in the Tata Group. In what was supposed to be a smooth transition, he appointed as his successor Cyrus Mistry, 44, whose family was the largest individual shareholder in the conglomerate.ImageMr.  Tata with his chosen successor, Cyrus Mistry, in 2012. Four years later, as tensions mounted between the two, Mr. Mistry was ousted by the Tata Group board. Credit...Vivek Prakash/ReutersInstead, the succession turned into the most high-profile corporate controversy in India’s recent history. As they had done two decades before when Ratan Tata was named the group’s successor, other Tata family and board members opposed the choice of Mr. Mistry. But with Ratan Tata’s support, Mr. Mistry won out.Over the next few years, however, tensions mounted between Mr. Mistry and Mr. Tata, who still exercised strong influence as chairman of the Tata Trusts, which controlled most of the conglomerate’s shares. Mr. Mistry divested several businesses that Mr. Tata had supported, and Mr. Tata disapproved of Mr. Mistry’s handling of the group’s international steel business and telecommunications ventures.In October 2016, less than four years after being appointed to head the Tata conglomerate, Mr. Mistry was ousted by Tata’s board with the full backing of Ratan Tata. Mr. Tata retook his position as chairman of the conglomerate until a successor was named by the board in February 2017.But Mr. Mistry did not go quietly. He sued the Tata group on the grounds that his removal was illegal. His allegations that the board fostered nepotism, ignored minority shareholders and tolerated misdeeds were given often sensational news media coverage over the next five years.Initially, the courts ruled in Mr. Mistry’s favor. But in 2021, the Supreme Court of India finally affirmed the legality of Mr. Mistry’s dismissal, ending the saga.The controversy detracted attention from Mr. Tata’s far-reaching philanthropies. In India, he disbursed much of his personal fortune on education, health and agricultural projects for poorer Indians. In the United States, he and Tata Trusts contributed millions of dollars to several universities — including his alma maters Cornell and the Harvard Business School — for research facilities and scholarship programs that carry the Tata name.ImageMr. Tata in 2022 after receiving an honorary doctorate from HSNC University in Mumbai. Credit...Punit Paranjpe/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesEnterprise and philanthropy had been at the heart of the Tata empire since its inception in 1868 by its founder, Jamsetji Tata. Jamsetji’s factories were among the first in the world to invest substantially in employee welfare, and he and his two sons left most of their estate and shares in the company to charitable trusts.Mr. Tata backed more than 50 startup companies in India, including e-commerce and digital payment platforms and an online lingerie retailer. But his favorite startup was Goodfellows, which encouraged friendships between older and younger Indians in business and other professions.At the launch of Goodfellows in Mumbai in 2022, he told an intergenerational audience, “You don’t mind getting old until you get old, and you find it’s a difficult world.”Shalini Venugopal Bhagat, Bernard Mokam and Mujib Mashal contributed reporting.A correction was made on Oct. 11, 2024: An earlier version of this obituary referred incorrectly to the Parsi community, to which Mr. Tata’s family belonged. It is an ethnic community, not a religion.When we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction.

      "To say that Ratan Naval Tata was a stalwart of the Indian automotive and manufacturing industry will be an understatement. An industrialist of immense magnitude, a towering personality and a keen business acumen coupled with an undying love for philanthropy and social responsibility, Mr. Tata wore many hats with aplomb. It was during his near two-decade tenure as the chairman of Tata Group, not only Mr. Tata reshaped and led the group through a resurgence, but also paved the way for the Indian automotive industry by executing extraordinary ideas and concepts, displaying sharp foresight and the will to go beyond the normal.1998: Introduction of Tata IndicaPhoto Credit: unknownIt was at the 1998 Auto Expo that the Tata Indica made its debut. It was the first indigenously developed car (four-wheeler), which was an idea that Mr. Tata held close to him. A car that was made for Indians, made by Indians and made in India. The Tata Indica was a car that revived the Tata Motors brand and moved away from big cars (407, Sierra, Sumo, Estate, Safari) to small, affordable cars. Despite a few niggles, the Tata Indica did well for the company, with its unique design, practicality, space and aggressive pricing.2008: Acquiring Jaguar Land Rover from Ford Motor CompanyOn June 2, 2008, Tata Motors made a 100 per cent acquisition of the iconic British automotive marque from Ford Motor Company for $2.3 billion (Rs. 9,200 crore) in an all-cash transaction. It was viewed as one of the boldest moves in the Indian automotive industry and was met with scepticism with Tata Motors going into debt and the global economic recession hitting all businesses hard. But eventually it did cement Tata Motors' status as not only a global automaker, who managed to turn JLR into a profitable business but also incorporate learnings from the British brand into its own cars.2008: Tata Nano - The 'one lakh' carMr. Tata envisioned that all Indians should have access to a car that they can own without a massive financial burden and graduate to, from a scooter or a motorcycle. And that led to the creation of Tata Nano, India's first car with a price tag of Rs. 1 lakh. The Tata Nano was a small petrol car, with 2-cylinder 624 cc engine, making 37 hp and 51 Nm. While the price tag remained Rs. 1 lakh only for a brief period of time and the Tata Nano did not fire the way Tata Motors imagined, it definitely made for solid learnings for the brand, going forward.These are just some of the achievements in the illustrious career of Mr. Ratan Tata. Others being the acquisition of Tetley Tea in 2000 and Corus Group in 2007, with the latter being one of the biggest acquisitions by an Indian company. The Corus Group was acquired by Tata Steel for a massive sum of $12 billion.Mr. Ratan Tata's legacy will remain unparalleled in the Indian automotive and manufacturing industry.\n",

      "This section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (March 2020)\n",
      "Tata Motors entered the passenger vehicle market in 1991 with the launch of the Tata Sierra, a multi utility vehicle. This was followed by the launch of the Tata Estate in 1992 (a stationwagon based on the existing TataMobile light commercial vehicle) and the Tata Sumo in 1994, India's first sports utility vehicle.\n",
      "Tata launched the Indica in 1998, the first fully indigenous Indian passenger car. Although initially criticised by auto-analysts, its excellent fuel economy, powerful engine and an aggressive marketing strategy made it one of the best selling cars in the history of the Indian automobile industry. A newer version of the car, named Indica V2, was a major improvement over the previous version and quickly became a mass favourite. Tata Motors also successfully exported large quantities of the car to South Africa. The success of Indica played a key role in the growth of Tata Motors.[3]\n",
      "In January 2008, Tata Motors launched Tata Nano, the least expensive production car in the world at about ₹120,000 (US$3,000).[4] The city car was unveiled during the Auto Expo 2008 exhibition in Pragati Maidan, New Delhi.[5]\n",
      "Tata has faced controversy over developing the Nano as some environmentalists like Anumita Roychoudhury, of the Centre for Science and Environment in Delhi,[6] and Rajendra K. Pachauri,[7] chairperson of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), are concerned that the launch of such a low-priced car could lead to mass motorization in India with adverse effects on pollution and global warming.[8][9] Tata had set up a factory in Sanand, Gujarat and the first Nanos were rolled out in summer of 2009.[1]\n",
      "Tata Motors Cars has launched further expansion into Southeast Asia by expanding into Vietnam and the Philippines.[2]\n",
      "At the 12th Auto Expo in February 2014, Tata Motors unveiled The Bolt, a hatchback and The Zest, a compact sedan.[10] They are slated to launch in August 2014.[11]\n",
      "Tata Motors increased its capital expenditure by 30 per cent to Rs 32,000 in order accelerate its shift toward electric vehicles\n",
      "In 2020, there were plans for Chinese auto maker Chery to buy a percentage of Tata Motors in order for Chery (who already make Jaguar Land Rover[12] cars in a joint venture in China) to gain entry into the Indian market and in order for Tata Motors to get technology for cars such as the proposed Tata Blackbird.[13][14] However, due to Covid-19 and the continuing political tensions over the Chinese/Indian border and other geopolitical reasons it is extremely unlikely that the company Chery will buy any part of Tata Motors.\n",
      "It was announced on May 30, 2022, Tata Motors signed an MOU with the Gujarat Government to acquire Ford India’s Sanand manufacturing plant.[15]\n",

He also took Tata Consultancy Services public, laying a strong foundation for the group's future endeavours.Remembering Ratan Tata: Visionary business leader who transformed Tata Group and championed philanthropyRatan Tata, who passed away on Wednesday at 86, was the one in the Tata Group who carried forward the pioneering spirit of predecessor JRD Tata as well as the founder Jamestji Tata. Under his leadership for nearly three decades, he reinvented the group in his own image of a cautious, savvy and gentle yet bold and daring entrepreneur. With his leadership, he not only transformed the Tata Group but also became the frontrunner of India's industrial transformation in many ways.#Pahalgam Terrorist AttackPakistan suspends Simla pact: What it means & who’s affectedWhat is India's defence muscle if it ever has to attack?Can Pakistan afford a full-scale war with India?How Ratan Tata wrote a prescient plan in 1983After Ratan Tata took over the chairmanship of Tata Industries from JRD, nearly a decade before Ratan succeeded him as the chairman of group holding company Tata Sons, he wrote the Tata Strategic Plan. Ratan Tata's plan would seem like a dream in the those days when Indian business and industry was in the straitjacket of licence raj and the Tata Group, the leader, was lumbering ahead with its legacy businesses, mostly of commodities.Ratan Tata thought that India would one day stop being a seller’s market which Tata ruled. But changing times, which Tata could foresee, would pose a challenge to the group.In her book, 'Business Maharajas', Gita Piramal writes about Tata's strategic plan which was prescient because India did change a lot after the 1991 liberalisation and inflow on foreign investment. \"Keen to change the passive image of the Tata Group, Ratan wanted to propel it to the cutting edge of technology. His argument was that the Tatas have all along been pioneers, taking up frontier industries. Jamsetji Tata set up steel and power plants in the last century when they were unheard of in India. Why should they restrain themselves in the ’70s?\"“You must remember there was an explosion of new emerging technologies in the West in the late ’70s: the super mini and personal computers, driven by microprocessor advances, artificial intelligence, the convergence of computing and communications into information technology and biotechnology,\" Piramal quotes Tata in her book. \"So I thought that the Tatas should be in these areas. We were among the few who would be willing and able to invest in these areas without expecting quick returns, I argued. Why shouldn’t Tatas enter those fields of recent technological advancement which have application potential in India?” JRD agreed to Ratan Tata's plan, saying only large groups could afford to take risks with new businesses and all industries are eventually going to be high-tech, Piramal writes.Live Events\"The hi-tech areas Ratan wanted to concentrate on were telecommunications, oil exploration services, computers and its associated businesses; advanced materials like special alloys and composites; and biotechnology and energy storage systems. Most of these areas were then closed to the private sector,\" Piramal writes. In those days, these things sounded quite revolutionary and only a rare entrepreneur would risk his capital on them.“However, I felt convinced that these were the areas Tatas must enter as they were the businesses of the future for India,\" Ratan Tata told Piramal. \"My point was, why should Tatas not be first. As it happened, with the first round of liberalization under Rajiv Gandhi, these were precisely some of the areas that were encouraged. Suddenly our success rate in getting licences was 100 per cent! So next we were running around trying to organize the necessary management and finance.”The plan faced resistance within the group and was revised, but it proved to be the manifesto of Ratan Tata's mission at the Tata Group as the conglomerate went on to add and build big brands in emerging businesses even as India too became a part of global economy.Ratan Tata's big and bold leapsRatan Tata assumed leadership of the conglomerate in 1991 from his uncle JRD Tata, just as India embarked on radical economic reforms that opened up the country to the world and ushered in an era of high growth.Under Tata's leadership, the group expanded its reach beyond Indian shores, acquiring British tea firm Tetley in 2000 for $432 million and Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus in 2007 for $13 billion, which was the biggest takeover of a foreign firm by an Indian company at the time. Tata Motors also acquired British luxury auto brands Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford Motor Co in 2008 for $2.3 billion. Tata's pet projects at Tata Motors included the Indica, \"the first car model designed and built in India,\" as well as the Nano, \"touted as the world's cheapest car.\" He contributed initial sketches for both models. While the Indica was a commercial success, the Nano faced challenges due to initial safety issues and marketing missteps, leading to its discontinuation a decade after its launch.In 2004, Tata took Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) public, raising $1.17 billion in India’s largest and Asia’s second-largest IPO at the time. In fact, TCS was the only major company from the group he took public.Tata Group bought state-owned Air India in 2021. It also started a full-service carrier, Vistara, with Singapore Airlines, but recently merged it with Air India.Tata retired in December 2012 but returned briefly as chair from October 2016 to February 2017 to address leadership challenges within the group. Even after his retirement, the group stuck to the pioneering spirit Tata had reinjected in the group. In less than 12 months, the group has unveiled its ambition to corner a significant chunk of India's future high-tech manufacturing. In November last year, it bought the India manufacturing facility of Taiwan's Wistron, becoming the first Indian company to join the Apple supply chain as an iPhone assembler. Four months later in March, ground was broken for two Tata semiconductor plants: a $11 billion semiconductor fab facility, the country's first, to be built by the Tata Group at Dholera in Gujarat.Tata did stumble on his journey of innovation, especially with Nano, the smallest car. Yet, despite its failure, Nano bears witness to Tata's imagination, pioneering vision and nationalistic spirit. Nano was a bold industrialist's tribute to the common Indian when India had broken free of the old socialist economy and was raring to go ahead. It was a defining feature of Tata's personality that he dared to dream big when most of his peers baulked at the risk and preferred to beat the old track. It was his urge to dream and innovate which made him back more than 50 startup companies in India. Ratan Tata's legacy will live on in every Indian entrepreneur who dares to dream and do it differently.(With inputs from TOI)(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)In Video: \n",

      "The Tata Nano is a city car/microcar manufactured and marketed by Indian automaker Tata Motors over a single generation from 2008–2018, primarily in India, as an inexpensive rear-engine hatchback for motorcycle and scooter drivers — with a launch price of ₹100,000 (US$2,500) on 10 January 2008.[5]\n",
      "Tata Motors projected production figures of 250,000 annually at launch. This was not achieved, and various factors led to a decline in sales volume, including delays during the factory relocation from Singur to Sanand, early instances of the Nano catching fire and the perception that the Nano was unsafe and lacked quality from its aggressive cost cutting. Actual sales reached 7,591 for model year 2016-2017. The project lost money, as confirmed by former Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry and by 2017 Tata Motors management.[6][7]\n",
      "In 2017, Tata Motors said manufacturing would continue due to the company's emotional commitment to the project.[8][9] Production was eventually halted in May 2018.[10] The Sanand Plant subsequently manufactured other hatchbacks, including the Tiago and Tigor.[11]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "History[edit]\n",
      "After successfully launching the low cost Tata Ace truck in 2005, Tata Motors began development of an affordable passenger car that would appeal to the many Indians who ride motorcycles.[12] The purchase price of this no frills auto was brought down by dispensing with most nonessential features, reducing the amount of steel used in its construction, and relying on low cost Indian labour.[citation needed]. The design featured only a driver's side wing mirror, one wiper blade, only three lug nuts per wheel and a fuel tank without filler cap.[13] Tata said it was the first time a 2-cylinder petrol engine was being used in a car with single balancer shaft.\n",
      "At introduction the Nano received attention due to its low price of 1 lakh rupees (Rs. 100,000).[14]  Some promotional material labeled the vehicle as \"The People’s Car\".[15]\n",
      "\n",
      "Expectations and effects[edit]\n",
      "Expectations created for the car during the run up to its production were out of proportion with realised sales. A 2008 study by Indian rating agency CRISIL projected the Nano would expand the nation's car market by 65%,[16] but, as of late 2012, news reports have detailed the underwhelming response of the Indian consumer to the offering; sales in the first two fiscal years after the car's unveiling remained steady at about 70,000 units. Tata intended to maintain a capacity to produce the car in much larger quantities, some 250,000 per year, should the need arise.[17]\n",
      "It was anticipated that its 2009 debut would greatly affect the used car market, and prices did drop 25–30% prior to the launch.[18] Sales of the Nano's nearest competitor, the Maruti 800, fell by 20% immediately following the unveiling of the Nano.[19] It is unknown if the Nano has had a lasting effect on the prices of and demand for close substitutes. In July 2012, Tata's Group chairman Ratan Tata, who retired in same year, said that the car had immense potential in the developing world while admitting that early opportunities were wasted due to initial problems.[20] Due to the sales drops, only a single unit was produced in June 2018. The Sanand Plant now produces other hatchbacks like Tiago and Tigor.[21]\n",

      "Singur factory pullout[edit]\n",
      "Main article: Tata Nano Singur controversy\n",
      "Tata Motors announced in 2006 that the Nano  would be manufactured in Singur, West Bengal.[22] Local farmers soon began protesting the 'supposed' forced acquisition of their land the new factory entailed.[22] Tata first delayed the Nano launch and later decided to build the car in a different state, Gujarat, instead.[23]\n",
      "\n",
      "Price[edit]\n",
      "Rear\n",
      "Announced as the most affordable production car in the world, Tata aimed for a price of one lakh rupees, or ₹100,000, which was approximately $2,000 US at the time.[24] Only the very first customers were able to purchase the car at that price, and as of 2017, the price for the basic Nano started around ₹ 215,000 ($3,400 US).[25] Increasing material costs may be to blame for this rapid rise in price.[26]\n",
      "Compared to the Volkswagen Beetle it had a relatively low price, though still high in terms of the average salary of an Indian industrial worker or farmer. In 1990, a Beetle from Mexican factories was priced at $5,300,[27] about $12,756 in 2022. The Ford Model T's initial price was about $850, equivalent to $29,747 in 2022. The price of the Nano was only just higher[28] than the corrected price of the Briggs & Stratton Flyer of the 1910s, with the Flyer costing US$125 ($1,767 in 2016), while the Flyer might be classified as more of a go-kart than a car.\n",

      "Tata GenX Nano (2015–2018)[edit]\n",
      "2015 Tata GenX Nano (facelift)\n",
      "In May 2015, to revive the model's sales, Tata Motors introduced a series of enhancements both inside and outside the car. The name was changed to GenX Nano to underline the changes, the range was offered in 21 different versions, among them a 5-speed automated manual transmission.[37] Electric power steering, air conditioning, and Bluetooth radio were available on top models in addition to new colors and alloy wheels. The body was strengthened and the front and rear bumpers were changed, which slightly increased the length to 3,164 millimeters. The interior was also redesigned with new fabrics and improved soundproofing. The rear hatchback and 5-seat homologation were introduced. The engine remained the 2-cylinder 624 cc (38.1 cu in) with 38 hp.[38][39]\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternative power plants[edit]\n",
      "The Nano was driven by a petrol engine. Though several variants were proposed, none were put into production. An upscale version was shown at an auto show.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compressed-air engine[edit]\n",
      "Tata Motors signed an agreement in 2007 with a French firm, Motor Development International, to produce a compressed air car Nano.[40] While the vehicle was supposed to be able to travel approximately 200 kilometres (120 mi) on $3 US of electricity to compress the air, Tata's Vice-President of Engineering Systems confirmed in late 2009 that vehicle range continued to be a problem.[40][41]\n",
      "\n",
      "Electric vehicle[edit]\n",
      "Tata discussed the possibility of producing an electric version,[42] and while it showcased an electric vehicle Nano at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show,[43] no such car came onto the market.\n",
      "If an EV Nano had been produced the expectations were that it would have been a highly affordable electric car[44] using lithium-ion batteries and having a range of 80 miles (130 km).[45] A Norwegian electric car specialist, Miljøbil Grenland AS, was named as a proposed partner in the project.[42]\n",
      "\n",
      "Tata Nano CNG emax (Bi-fuel)[edit]\n",
      "The Nano CNG emax was launched in October 2013. It could run on either gasoline or compressed natural gas. Initially, it was to be sold in Delhi and parts of Maharashtra and Lucknow, where CNG was available at fuel outlets.[46] The bifuel engine was powered by both CNG and petrol. In natural gas operation, the engine delivered maximum power of 33 horsepower and 45 Nm of maximum torque. The tank had a capacity of 32 liters (8 US Gal/7 UK Gal) of CNG.[47]\n",
      "\n",
      "Tata Super Nano[edit]\n",
      "In December 2014, Coimbatore-based JA Motorsport presented a 230 hp 1.3-liter engined version of the Nano called the 'Super Nano' at the Autocar Performance Show. Featuring a full body kit, slick tyres, a bolt-on roll cage, and smoked head and tail lamps, the Super Nano featured carbon fibre components, Recaro seats, and steering-mounted paddle shifters.[48]\n",
      "\n",
      "European export[edit]\n",
      "The Tata Nano Europa concept car\n",
      "An upscale Nano concept car called Nano Europa was shown at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show.[49] However, there was no progress towards producing or marketing this upscale specification.\n",
      "\n",
      "Car fires[edit]\n",
      "There were reports of several fire incidents involving the Nano.[50] The company denied those were connected to the car's design or its parts and blamed \"foreign electrical equipment\" found on top of the exhaust system.[50] The company offered to retrofit the exhaust and electrical systems but refused to recall the cars.[50] Tata extended the warranty on the car, including those already sold, from 18 months to four years in early December 2010.[50]\n",
      "\n",
      "Reception[edit]\n",
      "The Nano received a mixed reception from Indian consumers; reasons given included that it was still too expensive compared to a motorcycle, and the extended waiting time for delivery (a few months).[51] Although it was identified as the most affordable car,[52] a secondhand car that was more expensive when it was new gave more social status;  the Nano was considered a \"poor man's\" vehicle, turning some people away.[53] The fires and other safety issues were also a concern.[51]\n",
      "Tata Motors ended FY16 selling 21,012 Nanos, up from 16,901 in FY15.[54]\n",
      "\n",
      "Crash safety[edit]\n",
      "In 2014, Global NCAP crash-tested an Indian-market Tata Nano at the ADAC facility in Germany in its pilot round of 64km/h front offset deformable barrier crash tests for its Safer Cars for India project (similar to Latin NCAP 2013). They also crashed the Nano in the configuration for the UN's R94 test. Tata had made it public that a version of the Nano designed for export to Europe had passed R94, and they were also expecting a four star Euro NCAP result.[55] In contrast, the Indian car failed the R94 test and scored zero stars for adult and child occupant protection in Global NCAP's tests. The Nano was not fitted with airbags, not even one for the driver, nor ABS. During the 64km/h NCAP test the passenger compartment not only became unstable but also showed extremely high levels of intrusion of the steering column and waist-level intrusion of the A-pillar, showing high risk of life-threatening injury to the driver's head, neck and chest and also indicating that less critical body regions like the knees, tibias and feet were unlikely to be recoverable. The Nano had only static two-point seatbelts for the rear seats and no child seat available for sale in India could pass the installation check, meaning that the Nano was unsuitable for safely transporting children. It achieved zero stars for child occupant protection, scoring no points across all areas of assessment.[56][57]\n",
      "\n",
      "Sales[edit]\n",
      "At the time of launch Tata Motors planned to sell 250,000 units per year. The maximum sales ever achieved was 74,527 units during FY 2011-2012 and then sales declined rapidly year after year leading to a negligible market share of the car in the \"A\" segment. The product was expected to be phased out soon as dealers stopped placing orders.[58][59]\n",
      "FY 2009–2010 30,000 approx[60]\n",
      "FY 2010–2011 70,432[60]\n",
      "FY 2011–2012 74,527[60]\n",

      "FY 2017-2018 April - October 1,502\n",
      "\n",
      "End of production[edit]\n",
      "Due to the low sales of the model (only one Nano was assembled in June 2018 against the 275 assembled in June 2017) Tata Motors announced the end of production without any direct successor. The Nano wasn't accepted by potential buyers and sales were always lower than projected.[65]\n",
      "The Sanand Plant now produces other hatchbacks like Tiago and Tigor.[66]\n",
      "\n",
      "Rumored Revival[edit]\n",
      "In 2023 and 2024, according to some recent sources from news all over the world, there is some rumors that Tata could revive the Nano as an affordable all-electric car with roughly 150-250km range at a future date, though it is unknown when would the new second generation is going to be revealed.\n",

Tata envisages the Nano as a 'people's car' - India's answer to the Model T. But to bring his car to the people he must overcome some formidable challenges.

      "Nearly 72 hours before the launch of his dream car, Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata spent 90 minutes with ET for a one-on-one on the making of the people's car. He shares the trials and tribulations he faced during the journey. Here is the full text of the interview.Q: Are you nervous? Is this much bigger than the launch of Indica?I think I was much more nervous during the launch of Indica because we had never been in car manufacturing before. We were venturing into a new segment. We are again venturing into a new segment but in a product line in which we have 10 years of experience now. At the time of the Indica launch, you did not know whether the market would accept you becoming a car manufacturer from a truck manufacturer. We took some widely publicised goals at that time that we would be as big as the Ambassador, or we would have the same size of the Maruti or we would have a diesel engine. We made those statements. We didn't know those would be the kind of things the market would go for. So, I think at that time we were much more apprehensive and nervous than we are today.Q: If one would really start at the very beginning, what really was the trigger for the idea?Basically, just as an Indian, you know, I would be as concerned of my-self as one of the rickshaw pullers in Calcutta running with a rickshaw behind with two people sitting back. It bothered me. My mind will start thinking: Can we put a bicycle there? The same thing bothers me when I visit a plant also. The workers are bending over when the work piece should be raised or maybe they should sit in a pit or what-ever. Because I think human fatigue is something that affects safety.So in this particular case, you could not help but notice that there were three or four family members on a scooter, the kid standing in the front, the guy driving the scooter and the wife sitting side saddle holding a little kid. And when you're driving a car, you certainly say, Oh my god, be careful, they may slip. Add to that slippery roads and night time too. Any of these reasons can be dangerous for transport. That does not mean that the scooter should not exist because scooters are an evolution of bicycles and it is all the path of prosperity.And this seemed like a dangerous form of transport. So, I, to be frank if I might go through the process, I asked myself, what if you put two wheels on the back that will give greater stability? If you build a bar over the top could you save the occupant? I will stop there and come back. Last year, to my surprise I found that BMW had produced a scooter with the same bars that I had thought about with rubber bumpers on the side so that if they (the riders) fell they wouldn't hurt themselves and the seat there had a seatbelt. And I thought, that's exactly what I had thought about. The fact was that BMW had put this out though it was not successful and they had withdrawn it. But, someone else had also thought of the same thing. It had only two wheels not three. So, I set about thinking, can we make a four wheel vehicle from scooter parts initially and I, in fact, addressed an Automotive Component Manufacturers' Association (ACMA) meeting saying that can we all get together produce an Asian peoples' car. To this I never got very much response. The idea was a really low cost car that Malaysia, Indonesia and India could come together to produce jointly. We could produce one part, they could produce another part, and each one would exchange and have the rights. In fact, even for the Indica, I went to ACMA. I said can we have an Indian car because no car has been designed in India. That time I was actually criticised. This time I had no response. So, in this particular case I had no response. In fact, the person who showed some encouragement was Brij Mohan Munjal, but we never really took it further.And then we found that scooter parts were probably a real limitation. So we changed tack and we said let's take a clean sheet of paper and start thinking and conceiving a car. Why a clean sheet of paper? Because we thought that if we had to do something that was different, then we probably didn't want to have a legacy in any way or form and so we thought we should look at everything from scratch. And, initially I thought we could even have a car made from engineering plastics.But we found that several of these concepts do not lend themselves to either cost or volume manufacturing and have had to move away from that to a more conventional kind of car. So, that led us to configure a small car which would be not a three wheeler but four wheels. It would be a car, a full-fledged car and we started again in an evolutionary manner and we thought, and if I might say so, it really started with being a four wheel rural car. Do we have rolled up plastic curtains instead of windows? Do we have openings like auto rickshaws have instead of doors or do we have a safety bar? As we went on, we had many early concepts that went that kind of way till we finally decided that the market does not want a half car. The market wants a car. And if we want to build a peoples' car, it should be a car and not something that people would say, Ah! That's just a scooter with four wheels or an auto rickshaw with four wheels or not really a car and I was reminded of a very interesting concept that Chrysler did many years ago when they developed an Asian car. It was a plastic car and for those who may not know or remember, it was one piece, the whole car from front bumper to back bumper, moulded in one piece of plastic, half of it and the other half. And it was welded together to make the whole car.The most expensive part of any manufacturing unit is the paint shop. So this car with pigmentation with plastic parts, you didn't have to paint it, but no one liked the car because, in my view (I drove the car) it was very nice, but people wanted a real car and not something that someone would say was not a car, this is half-a-car or three-fourths of a car. So, with that kind of experience in mind, we decided we would do a car that would really pare the cost of a fair car. It has obviously been a long journey. It has been a longer journey than it should have been. I think we have easily taken two years or 18 months more than it should have been.Q: What were the most challenging moments to your mind? They all relate to costs. Perhaps the bigger, more visible issue is that somewhere we needed to benchmark ourselves against something. And we took the Maruti 800 as a benchmark. In terms of acceleration and driveability, it should at least equal the Maruti and in some areas it should exceed the Maruti. So, somewhere along the line we had to increase the size of the engine to give us the kind of performance which we have now and the rest have been issues, you know, relating to costs. It meant just doing the same thing again and again to bring the cost down, and where to put the fuel tank and all those kind of is-sues.Q: People are used to thinking within a certain framework. So how did you achieve breakthroughs in shaving off costs? We haven't changed when you see the car. It is a four-door car, five-seat, rear engine and in many ways conventionally constructed. What has been done is like (in the case of) door locks, we have the same lock on all four doors, both left hand and right hand. We have some parts that are wing locked from inside. To remove the engine you can work at from the top, it is in the rear. Probably when you see the car, we have really packaged it rather tightly and I think most of the benefit we got on cost was that we used less steel and we just made the car smaller outside yet big inside.Q: You think that this car is going to some way change the DNA of the group? That is not what it was conceived for. Well, the fact that you are doing it to address the market, that's huge. It gives you an expectation of, you know, if we produce 50,000 of such cars then we are ready to undertake that exercise. From the time we are thinking that we could follow on with this, could be different fuels can be produced, an electric version of the car can be produced or hybrid version of this car or can we make this car the platform for a new set of personal transport. The one thing that I think we have established is that we have created an affordable, personal form of transport. Some may like it, some may not. Some may think it has things that it shouldn't have, while some may think it is coarser than it should be. But we have an affordable form of transport that will take four or five people in all weather conditions to where they want to go, running on regular fuel and not some exotic fuel.Q: There has been some criticism that this car is going to choke the already congested roads in cities. Do you think that is an elitist criticism? Yeah, I asked myself. We produced about 7 million two wheelers earlier. Today, we almost have about 60-70 million two to three wheelers in the country. We produced about 1.4 million cars and at some point we will exceed 2 million. Nobody said anything about that. It only happens to be this car that is being targeted. You may say well OK the two wheeler takes lesser space. Our car pollutes if not less, then certainly not more than a two wheeler and I am not talking per passenger but as a vehicle. We conform to Euro IV in terms of our engine. Today Bharat III is required, we conform to Bharat III. All scooters and two wheelers are Bharat II today, not that they are not conforming, but that's what their standard is. So, all I want to say is that yes you may take a view that this small car will take less space than a large car. Yes, you may say that this car will carry four people instead of the normal two on a scooter and therefore you will have if, filled in with four people, you will have less on the road than two scooters. More of immediate concern, for anyone that drives a car, is that today two or three wheelers have become a little more of a menace on the road than a car has become because of their ability to weave in and out. And it makes an assumption that a small car will not replace a bigger car. It just looks at it as an increment. You produce two million cars, you produce half-a-million Tata cars, you produce 2.5 million cars. That's not quite the way it is going to work. We will cannibalise some of the existing low-end cars or cannibalise some of the existing two wheelers. Some of the cannibalisation will be of our own product and Indica is also going to feel the effects of this. So, it will not be that it will just sit on top of everything and there won't be a square inch of space on the road or anything of this nature. Secondly, we are looking at congestion in major cities. Have we drafted a form of affordable form of family transport for people in tier II or tier III cities. Is it their lot not to have it? Is it a sin to try to give it to them? Does it necessarily mean that the small car is only congesting the city roads in the major cities and that nothing is being done in the urban areas. Yes, we have high teledensity in the urban areas, we haven't done enough in the rural areas, but there is huge potential if rural India gets connected and the same is going to be true with transport.Q: Who are your potential customers for this car? Are you really looking at tier II and tier III towns and cities?I think I would rather not look at it geographically. I would say: who might be the buyer of this small car? Let's start at the top. If I were to look in the United States or in Europe, in some of the garages you would have a Bentley or two Bentleys' or a high-end Mercedes, and you may find a Smart also in that same garage because that person thinks it’s a fun extra car to have. He may have four cars, but also have a Smart because he thinks it is cute. Doesn't need it, but he may have it. Then you may have a person who needs a utilitarian form of transport. He is not looking for a lot of creature comforts; he wants to get around in a sensible way. Then you think of a person who is perhaps thinking of or owns an existing small car. And to him it makes sense to get it because it is more fuel efficient or its lower cost or whatever it may be. And then on the other side you have someone who aspires for a car which is beyond his reach. He doesn't have a car or he has a two wheeler or a three wheeler and this fills his needs. And then, this can come from anywhere in the country.Q: Over the years as I have observed you, the thing that comes to my mind is the loneliness of the long-distance runner. Has it been lonely for you because you have dug in, in the face of considerable criticism, especially in the first eight to ten years?Yes, it is interesting for you to say that because that really says a lot. But look at this particular project. You know, when I looked at the Indica, all my friends overseas said that you can't do it; its not the time and you will have to go through an agonising phase. My friends here said when it was under production that you would produce a lemon. They would beg me to distance myself from the Indica project. If things get OK, then of course, everybody is your friend again.But it can get, just as you said, fairly lonely. On this car, I think, there was a fair amount of ridicule when the project started that it is a pipe dream and in honesty that would have extended into the company also in certain quarters. That it can't be done and then I was caught in the web. And as one went along, it became clear that something was happening and we were going forward. Suddenly everybody is against the small car, it will pollute, it is going to congest, it is going to impair safety.But we decided that we will make a car that will meet all those criteria. We decided we will not compromise. We designed the car with a full frontal crash test and to also offset a side crash impact. It will meet all international standards of safety. It will meet emission standards, not only today's Indian standards, but also Euro IV, today as it stands. So, on safety and emissions we spared nothing.On fuel efficiency, we have a very fuel efficient engine which is no big deal because we have a very small engine. So, a 33 horse power engine will give around 50 miles per gallon. It is not too bad for a car. So, through this period of time, these have been the attacks. Fortunately, we have not sought any crutches in terms of concessions. So we have done more in fact in many ways than the so-called small cars have done or the micro cars have done in Europe which don't meet many of these criteria. We feel quite pleased and right now I am in a very lonely phase that on the one hand it is attracting a lot of attention positively, but it is also attracting a lot of attention negatively like everybody is taking potshots at in the form that this is not something that we needed to have.Q: Would you also have a lot of people emulating your example in the sense of wanting to build a $ 3000 car?I think, my friend Carlos Ghosn has been the only person in the automotive area who has not scoffed at this. He has from day one said that this is a possibility that could only be done in a place like India. And he has not ridiculed anything. From day one he just said that it is possible in a place like India, but not possible anywhere else.Q: When other car makers enter the same space, how do you reckon the belly of the market will get segmented? I think the best way to answer that is to again go back in time. Maruti was the only manufacturer in the low-end car space. At that time, I felt that it needed to be challenged so we started on the small car in that space. I knew at that time the European manufacturers and the other Japanese manufacturers would never be able to produce a comfortable car. The Koreans could, and they did. By the time the Indica came out, so did Santro, so did Matiz. And they came out all about the same time. Theoretically, I thought I was the only one. May be they thought they were too. But then we realised that we were all coming out at the same time, and we had three offerings of the new price dimension and a more modern car than the Maruti. That probably added considerably to the growth of the car industry and it probably should have had the same reaction as this one is because it is exactly the same thing. Maruti was producing about 150,000 cars at that time. The 800 was the only one and I think by the time the Esteem had come, 180,000 cars or may be 200,000 cars were being produced. A few years later, Indica was itself over 200,000 cars per year. So the same kind of paradigm change that took place at that time could happen within just the small cars. So, if Bajaj and Mahindras and whoever produce small cars, then 3 or 4 brands of small cars will be available to choose from. I don't believe that Tata Motors can fulfill the entire demand of the country.Q: But how would you signal differentiation to the customer?I don't know because I don't know what they would have. All I would say is that probably of the players that we are talking of, I couldn't say that, because I was going to say that the outlets or the distribution networks might be an important thing. But I take that back because the two wheeler distribution outlets may serve well to do this and a tractor distribution outlet may also work well. So, I don't know what would differentiate this from the others. The product itself would have to be differentiated. The one thing I wish to do, is I want to have several follow-on products, following this. Moving up market because we have a great advantage, we start with a very low base so we add content to this. We are very competitive as we move up. Today for example, the Smart is an expensive car. If it started at a very low base and you added content, it would be a very competitive car when you loaded it. I feel that there is probably a market, maybe outside India more than India for a fully loaded power steering, automatic transmission, power windows, air conditioned kind of car with a bigger engine at a very affordable price, which is far lower than what is available elsewhere and we should be able to address that kind of market also.Q: In terms of the various things that you have done in your life, like this small car and Indica, would you consider this as more interesting? I think so, because more new ground has been broken here than on Indica.Q: Is it bigger than the Corus deal? Corus is a transaction. It got us a lot of visibility, but Corus is a trans-action. We didn't build anything. There is a different level of excitement when you are building something.Q: You have been quoted in the media the last couple of weeks saying that this would be an ideal time after the launch of the small car to step down. How serious are you about it? All I said, you know, I think in everybody's life there is a certain amount of moments of satisfaction. You feel, that after that has been achieved it is a nice time to step away or change gears and that's why I said that in an ideal world this would be a good time to step away. I didn't say that this is what I would. You've achieved something, it is successful, it is a nice time to leave because you may not have the luxury of being able to do that, but it is a nice time to leave. And you don't want ever to have a situation where somebody sort of whispers, when is he going to leave? You know, recently I had an occasion to meet Michael Schumacher and I asked him, are you sorry you retired? And he said, No. I retired at the peak of my career. How much more could I have done? I may have gone down. I am now a test driver for Ferrari and I am enjoying what I am doing. And he said that I am enjoying my new life and I really am enjoying myself. And I think there is a lot there to what he said. You don't like to fade away because of hanging in there for too long, you love to be on the back of something that is exciting. So it is a true statement and not hypocritical.Q: In the last few years things have started to come together. Don't you think it is a good time that you should concentrate on consolida-tion considering the last few years?I would prefer to just say that I wish I was 10 or 15 years younger, not to do what you have said, but because today the country is really on the move which it could have been five years earlier, but it wasn't. And hopefully it will keep on moving in that direction. May be it will taper off, may be something will happen in the region that may make it happen. You can't say that just by staying you can make things happen better and that should not therefore be the reason to stay. You know, let us just take a hypothetical case. Suppose I had spent the last four years in this dream project and it didn't happen. There is tremendous disappointment, but it could happen. I think when it comes to time or point when you have to leave if it doesn't happen, then you could go out in disgrace. So you know there are times when you feel that in an ideal world this would be a nice time. That might be a nice time, and just by staying doesn't make it better.Q: Didn't you find a successor that fitted the bill 100%? No I didn't. I needed more time. And the reason that Mr A or Mr B or Miss or Mrs C is not named or in place because I think to do that too early is also bad because that person is then asking that question, when I am going to leave? And secondly, those who didn't want to unseat that person would be hard at work trying to make sure that happens three years or eighteen months before they think it should be announced and the person should be anointed and one should start to give that person a chance to operate.Q: Do you have somebody in mind? I have several people in mind and have a problem finding the right person.Q: Are you doing this search yourself or is there a committee at Tata Sons? No, there is no committee at Tata Sons, maybe there should be.Live EventsQ: Would you like someone from within or outside? I don't think I would like to answer that because it would be prejudging an issue. It should be an open issue, an issue where the person could come from anywhere.Q: Would the person have to be an Indian? That's putting lots of words in my mouth. Theoretically, it need not be an Indian, but I think, it would be a good thing if it was an Indian as we are an Indian company, but we are attractively international so to a degree it could be a person from anywhere. But since almost 200,000 people are in India, he should have a keen understanding of India.Q: You have made the point earlier how you would like to see more IPR being created within the group. What to your mind are really the barriers that are coming in the way? What does it take for industrial corporations like Tata Motors to innovate in a knowledge era?I think the one thing that needs to happen is that challenges need to be given to the organisation. Let's discuss about Tata Motors. In developing the small car, we have filed 40 patents in relation to the small car. Tata Motors since last year has filed some 200 patents; the year before we filed 30. And probably if I go back, then for three years we didn't file any. The truth is I think that if there are challenges thrown across and those challenges are difficult then some interesting, innovative solutions will come. If you don't have those challenges then, I think, the tendency is go on to say that whatever will happen, will take place in small deltas. In a way, this is my hypothesis: we have a history in India of being licensed manufacturers. Know-how came from somewhere, we produced the product, we badged it ourselves or we put the foreign badges, put it into the market and in some cases, Indian companies were free to enhance that product, while in other cases they had no right to touch that product from what it was. I think that reduced challenges to just meeting cost challenges in manufacturing etc. And therefore in manufacturing, we learnt from systems that foreign partners brought, we learnt from techniques that existed and we added some in India. We never really, except in the pharma area, tried to venture out on our own. And I think, many of our companies changed that. You know normally, if you want to do something, the normal reaction from the Indian manufacturer is who are the people doing this? See if I can get a JV with them and come to India. There are some who think I can do everything myself and there are some who make use of reverse engineering and come into the market. In either of those challenges, the real challenge is when you have some strength and you really choose to throw out the gauntlet that you can do X. And it ought to be the kind of challenge which somebody says that can't be done because then that really becomes the engine of innovation. So Kennedy said can you send a man to the moon? I think at that time, they certainly wouldn't have believed that it could be done. It was tough. Since then we haven't had those kinds of challenges. We haven't said we will send a man to Mars, we may put landers on Mars, but we have not done those kinds of things. It is those areas which really create the innovation that we need.Q: In terms of your global aspirations for the small car, how do you propose to sequence it? I think the first thing I would like to do is get a mature product in the Indian market and seed this market effectively. My aim was that I would produce a certain volume of cars and then I would create a very low-cost, low break-even plant that a young entrepreneur could buy and that a bunch of young entrepreneurs could establish an assembly operation. Then Tata Motors would train their people who would oversee quality assurance and they would become a satellite assembly operation for us.So we would create entrepreneurs across the country over time that would produce the same car. We would produce all the mass items and ship it to them as kits so its similar to an SKD or CKD operation. The assemblers would also be the dealers for the car and thus we would eliminate one level. First, I would like to do that in India and it will be very satisfying if the small car created 10 or 15 satellite groups of young engineers who thought they could get together and do a business, but which they would never be able to get, normally, like in the assembly of cars or be involved in an industry of that nature. That will be a very satisfying thing for me. What we do outside India will probably be a more conventional distribution system. An assembly plant where we can assemble the product in a more conventional form.Q: But would you look at largely India-like markets? Well, the obvious markets overseas for us would be the African markets, the Latin American markets like Brazil, Argentina and some of the Far East countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, etc. Those would be the markets. There are people who say that this product could be quite acceptable in Europe, but that is not the market that excites me so much.Q: Is Fiat going to play a role in the overseas distribution and marketing of this product?There is no agreement to play a role. But I think we both have a view that wherever one is stronger than the other we will seek to leverage that strength. Fiat has assembly plants in Brazil and Argentina. In other markets like South Africa, we have a better market presence than they do. So it varies, but we have not made any decision or even discussed this.Q: Has someone from China been interested to associate with you for this car? No.Q: Are you concerned about the IPR issues there or would you venture into that market? I wouldn't venture into that market because it would be a matter of time before we would be out in that market.Q: Recently, you suggested that it's easier to do business abroad and in this kind of an environment you have opportunistic companies coming to India whereas the more established companies from India are looking abroad. What is the single biggest change that you think business needs in the country to function optimally?Yeah, I said that with a particular context. We have three greenfield steel sites just going around in circles, mining rights not being given, they are being given to X but not to Y, captive coal mines are not being settled. You want to build a car plant in West Bengal because you want the state to industrialise, for no other reason than that you want to industrialise that part of the country. You get caught in a political crossfire and you find yourself facing the gamble between here and building there sort of syndrome. So, then you ask yourself, this seldom happens in other countries. If you went out to build a small car plant in South Africa, it might be out and running by now. And I said this in the context of Corus. When I have acquired 18 to 20 million tonnes of additional capacity, I wanted to do it in India. I would still and I hope we can do it in India, but it would take another 5 years or 6 years, if everything gets settled. So for one reason or other, particularly now when land is involved or natural resources are involved it seems to be taking much more time to get something done in India than it would if I were to go to Brazil and buy an iron ore mine and set up a steel plant assuming that that were possible.Q: Were the initial years in this project a low point when the costs were increasing in 2005? Did you think that it may not be possible? Yeah, it put additional pressure and that was also part of the reason why the project took longer than it did because it would have been very easy to say that let's scrap the Rs 1-lakh goal that we had set for ourselves and make it 2 or something, which also would have been different. So it would have been easy to say that let's go on in that sense. But, the view we took was that we should continue to operate towards the same goals.Q: Was it a deliberate tack: the Rs 1-lakh figure? No. I said quite openly that it was at Geneva Motorshow that the FT reporter asked me about the car and what it would cost and I said about a 100,000 rupees. It got flashed, that's how it happened.Q: For a project of this kind to succeed, suppliers also have to respond differently. How easy or difficult was it to drive innovation across the extended enterprise?I think more than anything else the vendors disbelieved that the project was real. That's been a bigger issue, you know, because it has not been that they have not been able to respond. They did not expend their energies to respond to the same criteria we did, they didn't respond because they thought it was a hypothetical project. The real interest has come after they have seen us invest in the site in Singur. I think that the amount of vendor interest that we have created, the kind of inputs, the kind of aggression that we see from the vendors now has gone up exponentially because they now realise that this is a real project, there will be volumes and they have the chance to address that kind of demand.Q: Didn't any of the vendors have the pragmatism to really figure out that this was a big opportunity? I think of those who would have to make an investment as against those who would have to provide components out of their existing facility, it is the first lot that would have had the disbelief. If you take a company like Bharat Forge, it will be really happy to forge front ends for a small car or crank shafts or something.But someone who would like to go and set up a new tail light factory for the small car or produce a part that would take a considerable amount of investment from him and you are not willing to give him the guarantee that you will off-take X, it's that kind that would not spend the money to try to kind of put together a proposal for that project as he doesn't think that project is really going to happen. It is that kind of situation. So, I should say that more of this car has been made under rapid prototyping by us than you would find in standard cars.Q: How have you changed as a person over the years? I have become older. (laughs)Q: With the small car project and the Jaguar likely to co-exist inside Tata Motors how will the organisation structure look like? I don't think the two have to be looked at in continuity. I think it is possible that you can have high-end brands because the SUV part of it, Land Rover, can sit squarely on top of our business. The other side, I think is a luxury car we don't have and it would be a great mistake to try and integrate it. It should be nurtured as a brand and hopefully come back to its previous image which was a great image at one time.Q: You were initially frustrated with the resistance that you met from colleagues. Is that resistance over now? Yes I do.Q: What kind of resistance was it, to new ideas, to new ways of doing things? I think, we were a group that would not work in a particular way for many years and we weren't fully sensitive to the changing environment around us. So anything that was new, we felt it was better to be where we were, tested and tried, I think, that's changed.Prime ExclusivesInvestment IdeasStock Report PlusePaperWealth EditionWhy Trump wants a ‘weak’ dollar, and what makes it an opportunity, or a challenge, for IndiaDo Gensol, IndusInd revive corporate governance worries?Asian Paints is trading at P/E lower than pandemic levels.

      "Former corporate public relations professional Niira Radia in her first media interview in over 12 years and the first ever on the Tata group shared snippets from the time she worked with industrialist and philanthropist Ratan Tata, who died at 86 on October 9.The launch of Tata Motors' hatchback Indica, the big-ticket acquisition of the steel major Corus, the purchase of Jaguar Land Rover from Ford, and the launch of the 'Rs 1 lakh car' Nano, among others - Ms Radia shared stories behind these milestones of the Tata group as a global enterprise headquartered in India.\"He was a dreamer and a visionary. India was his national pride. He loved his country, the people. He'd say it was so important to globalise. 'The only reason why I need to go global is to bring technology to India and upgrade our own companies to make better platforms', Ratan Tata would say,\" Ms Radia told NDTV in an exclusive interview today.She explained why Ratan Tata decided on making the 'Rs 1 lakh car' Nano, a statement which has been narrated many times over the years.\"He wanted something for the common person. He wanted a person on a bike to not get wet in the rain, for example. A newspaper had said Ratan Tata wanted a Rs 1 lakh car. But we had never given a number,\" said the former chairperson of the defunct company Vaishnavi Corporate Communications, who had an inside view of some of the most crucial decisions made by the Tata group.READ | Niira Radia Recounts Her Association With Humble Leader Ratan TataOn why Ratan Tata chose Singur in West Bengal as the site for building the Nano, Ms Radia said the industrialist simply had his heart set on Bengal to create jobs and bring industrialization.\"He announced Singur. It really surprised me because we were not told about the location earlier. It was natural for him. Why shouldn't it be Singur? He was for development, not to play politics,\" Ms Radia said.Tata group was in talks on the big-ticket Corus deal when the huge battle over the Nano plant in Bengal erupted, Ms Radia told NDTV, adding they were in Bengal in the midst of two critical decisions - a bid was going on for Corus, and there was trouble on the ground in Singur.\"Why should the Rs 1-lakh car be not built in Bengal? His dream was to industrialise the state... I think this Rs 1 lakh number was there because he must have done his calculation at that time, that it may be possible. Of course he was criticised too. But the man had a dream, he had a vision. Those were more important,\" Ms Radia said.\"He was disappointed,\" she added, on the Nano not reaching heights Ratan Tata may have envisaged.\"The price point changed subsequently. I want to stay focused on who he was, not the business side. When he went to Bengal, he felt it needed to be industrialised. He wanted to create jobs. The whole road from Kolkata to Singur could have been developed beautifully. It (Nano project) went to Sanand (in Gujarat). Today, Sanand is like Gurugram,\" Ms Radia said.READ | Niira Radia Recounts When Ratan Tata's Dog Went Missing On Marine DriveThe Singur problem was not about the Nano or Ratan Tata, she said.\"The fight was a political fight. Singur was the constituency of a leader of the then ruling party... We visited many other states to look for a site. We were also called by Punjab, Karnataka, many others... We went to Gujarat as it was a bit more industrialised and moving towards development, so it would be easy to set up there,\" said Ms Radia, who handled public relations for the Tata group between 2000 and 2012.Ms Radia headed Vaishnavi Communications during the most critical time when the Tata group decided to consolidate its brand at the group level. She also remained a dear friend and a close confidante of Ratan Tata till his death.\n",

Ratan Naval Tata could not only see into the distance but also attain to the wingspan required to reach there. He was also one who dared to compose dreams on an epic scale but knew how to symphonise all the nuances to turn them into material reality. Yet he always cloaked his greatness with a rare humility and compassion. “I would like to be remembered as a person who was responsible for some change in the way we look at things,” he said in a rare interaction with the media in 2021. And then he added, “As the innovator of something that people thought was unviable and not possible.”advertisementRatan Tata, 86, who died late evening on October 9 in Mumbai following age-related illness, was all that and much, much more.

He had big shoes to fill when he took over the reins of the Tata Group from the illustrious J.R.D. Tata in 1991. Ratan was in awe of JRD and shared his interests in flying and electronics. He would say later, “Jeh (JRD) was an epitome of humility. He would stand in line to check in, drive his own car. What I learnt from him and have carried with me is a sense of justice that is always prevalent. He always did the right thing irrespective of how difficult it was and stood up for principles and stood by people.”'),\n",

He returned to India only because his grandmother, Lady Navajbai Tata, wanted him back. She was the one who brought him and his brother Jimmy up ever since their parents had separated, and she was getting old.\\n\\n\\nTwo weeks after returning to India, he was sent to the Jamshedpur plant of Telco (now Tata Motors ) as an apprentice and later to Tisco (now Tata Steel) to hone his skills. He seemed to have forged his own work ethic then, rolling up his sleeves on the shop floor and sharing meals with the workers in the canteen. In retrospect, it would seem some of that steel rubbed off on him—along with the simplicity and lack of humbug from his mates.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='When Ratan Tata took over from JRD, it was the dawn of liberalisation in India and there were conflicting currents of enterprise and protectionism. Tata’s instinct was to venture outward, towards the global stage, rather than inward. The Tata Group was then still a loose confederation of companies, but bound by common synergies with the centre (read, Tata Sons) giving it strategic leadership. In his early years as helmsman, he laid down his motto: that the group was more important than individual companies. That meant, to unify the command structure and attain coherence of purpose, he had to sack an array of Tata satraps like Russi Mody, Ajit Kerkar and Darbari Seth who ran their own “fiefdoms”.It was also necessary to make the group nimble-footed and competitive.

These included purchases of the UK’s Tetley Tea in 2000 for $450 million, Daewoo Commercial Vehicles in 2004 for $102 million, Singapore’s NatSteel the same year for $486 million, British steelmaker Corus in 2007 for $13 billion and the Jaguar-Land Rover from Ford Motor Company in 2008 for $2.3 billion.

Following the showdown, Tata came out of retirement to be interim chairman for a brief period before anointing Tata veteran and close confidant N. Chandrasekaran as group chairman. The Singur controversy where Tata Motors’ Nano plant had to shift its factory from West Bengal to Gujarat in 2008 following farmers’ resistance had been another tough episode.

He continued to be chairman of Tata Trusts, the philanthropic arm of the Tatas, which holds 66 per cent stake in Tata Sons. Of late, in the winter of his life, he had also taken to sharing his past, via retro pics on Instagram.

His demise marks the close of a remarkable chapter in the annals of global business. A towering figure in Indian industry, Tata was a man of quiet dignity, profound foresight, and a deep-rooted sense of social responsibility.Here are Ratan Tata's Key Achievements: A storied beginningBorn in Mumbai (then Bombay) on December 28, 1937, into the illustrious Tata family, Ratan Tata was destined for a life of significance. Yet, his rise to prominence was never one of mere inheritance. Raised by his grandmother, Lady Navajbai Tata, in the aftermath of his parents’ separation, Tata grew up with an understated sense of duty that would shape his approach to life and business.\"),\n",

It was here that Tata first developed a passion for design—an inclination that would later influence some of his most iconic business ventures. He further honed his managerial acumen at Harvard Business School, completing the Advanced Management Program in 1975.A reluctant leader who transformed the Tata GroupRatan Tata’s early years at the Tata Group were characterised by a deliberate avoidance of any overt reliance on his family name. He began his career on the shop floor at Tata Steel, where he worked alongside blue-collar laborers, learning the business from the ground up. This humility and hands-on experience would define his approach to leadership in the years to come.When Tata assumed leadership of the Tata Group in 1991, he inherited an empire steeped in legacy but in need of reinvention.

What followed was nothing short of a corporate renaissance. During his two-decade tenure as chairman, Tata transformed the sprawling conglomerate from a predominantly India-focused entity into a global enterprise. Under his stewardship, the Group expanded into over 100 countries, with nearly two-thirds of its revenue generated from outside India.Key achievementsAmong Tata’s most notable accomplishments were his bold acquisitions of international brands, a testament to his vision of making the Tata Group a global player. The acquisition of Tetley Tea in 2000 marked the first significant overseas purchase by an Indian company, setting the tone for what was to come. The group went on to acquire the UK’s Corus Steel in 2007 and the iconic Jaguar Land Rover in 2008,'),\n",

The legal battle that ensued raised questions about governance within the group, putting Tata in the unfamiliar position of being at the center of public scrutiny.

He famously declined a bribe when his company was bidding to start an airline, underscoring his belief that profits should never come at the expense of one’s principles.Tata’s retirement in 2012 marked the end of an era for the conglomerate, but his influence remained palpable.

(March 2020)\\nTata Motors entered the passenger vehicle market in 1991 with the launch of the Tata Sierra, a multi utility vehicle. This was followed by the launch of the Tata Estate in 1992 (a stationwagon based on the existing TataMobile light commercial vehicle) and the Tata Sumo in 1994, India's first sports utility vehicle.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='Tata launched the Indica in 1998, the first fully indigenous Indian passenger car. Although initially criticised by auto-analysts, its excellent fuel economy, powerful engine and an aggressive marketing strategy made it one of the best selling cars in the history of the Indian automobile industry. A newer version of the car, named Indica V2, was a major improvement over the previous version and quickly became a mass favourite. Tata Motors also successfully exported large quantities of the car to South Africa. The success of Indica played a key role in the growth of Tata Motors.[3]\\nIn January 2008, Tata Motors launched Tata Nano, the least expensive production car in the world at about ₹120,000 (US$3,000).[4] The city car was unveiled during the Auto Expo 2008 exhibition in Pragati Maidan, New Delhi.[5]'),\n",

Pachauri,[7] chairperson of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), are concerned that the launch of such a low-priced car could lead to mass motorization in India with adverse effects on pollution and global warming.[8][9] Tata had set up a factory in Sanand, Gujarat and the first Nanos were rolled out in summer of 2009.[1]\\nTata Motors Cars has launched further expansion into Southeast Asia by expanding into Vietnam and the Philippines.[2]'),\n",

So next we were running around trying to organize the necessary management and finance.”The plan faced resistance within the group and was revised, but it proved to be the manifesto of Ratan Tata\\'s mission at the Tata Group as the conglomerate went on to add and build big brands in emerging businesses even as India too became a part of global economy.Ratan Tata\\'s big and bold leapsRatan Tata assumed leadership of the conglomerate in 1991 from his uncle JRD'),\n",

In less than 12 months, the group has unveiled its ambition to corner a significant chunk of India's future high-tech manufacturing. In November last year, it bought the India manufacturing facility of Taiwan's Wistron, becoming the first Indian company to join the Apple supply chain as an iPhone assembler. Four months later in March, ground was broken for two Tata semiconductor plants: a $11 billion semiconductor fab facility, the country's first, to be built by the Tata Group at Dholera in Gujarat.Tata did stumble on his journey of innovation, especially with Nano, the smallest car.

Yet, despite its failure, Nano bears witness to Tata's imagination, pioneering vision and nationalistic spirit. Nano was a bold industrialist's tribute to the common Indian when India had broken free of the old socialist economy and was raring to go ahead. It was a defining feature of Tata's personality that he dared to dream big when most of his peers baulked at the risk and preferred to beat the old track. It was his urge to dream and innovate which made him back more than 50 startup companies in India.

Actual sales reached 7,591 for model year 2016-2017. The project lost money, as confirmed by former Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry and by 2017 Tata Motors management.[6][7]\\nIn 2017, Tata Motors said manufacturing would continue due to the company's emotional commitment to the project.[8][9] Production was eventually halted in May 2018.[10] The Sanand Plant subsequently manufactured other hatchbacks, including the Tiago and Tigor.[11]\"),\n",

The design featured only a driver\\'s side wing mirror, one wiper blade, only three lug nuts per wheel and a fuel tank without filler cap.[13] Tata said it was the first time a 2-cylinder petrol engine was being used in a car with single balancer shaft.\\nAt introduction the Nano received attention due to its low price of 1 lakh rupees (Rs. 100,000).[14]  Some promotional material labeled the vehicle as \"The People’s Car\".[15]'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Expectations and effects[edit]\\nExpectations created for the car during the run up to its production were out of proportion with realised sales. A 2008 study by Indian rating agency CRISIL projected the Nano would expand the nation's car market by 65%,[16] but, as of late 2012, news reports have detailed the underwhelming response of the Indian consumer to the offering; sales in the first two fiscal years after the car's unveiling remained steady at about 70,000 units. Tata intended to maintain a capacity to produce the car in much larger quantities, some 250,000 per year, should the need arise.[17]\"),\n",

In July 2012, Tata's Group chairman Ratan Tata, who retired in same year, said that the car had immense potential in the developing world while admitting that early opportunities were wasted due to initial problems.[20] Due to the sales drops, only a single unit was produced in June 2018. The Sanand Plant now produces other hatchbacks like Tiago and Tigor.[21]\"),\n",

In 1990, a Beetle from Mexican factories was priced at $5,300,[27] about $12,756 in 2022. The Ford Model T's initial price was about $850, equivalent to $29,747 in 2022. The price of the Nano was only just higher[28] than the corrected price of the Briggs & Stratton Flyer of the 1910s, with the Flyer costing US$125 ($1,767 in 2016), while the Flyer might be classified as more of a go-kart than a car.\"),\n",

He shares the trials and tribulations he faced during the journey. Here is the full text of the interview.Q: Are you nervous? Is this much bigger than the launch of Indica?I think I was much more nervous during the launch of Indica because we had never been in car manufacturing before. We were venturing into a new segment. We are again venturing into a new segment but in a product line in which we have 10 years of experience now. At the time of the Indica launch, you did not know whether the market would accept you becoming a car manufacturer from a truck manufacturer. We took some widely publicised goals at that time that we would be as big as the Ambassador, or we would have the same size of the Maruti or we would have a diesel engine. We made those statements. We didn't know those would be the kind of things the market would\"),\n",

So, I think at that time we were much more apprehensive and nervous than we are today.Q: If one would really start at the very beginning, what really was the trigger for the idea?Basically, just as an Indian, you know, I would be as concerned of my-self as one of the rickshaw pullers in Calcutta running with a rickshaw behind with two people sitting back. It bothered me. My mind will start thinking: Can we put a bicycle there? The same thing bothers me when I visit a plant also.

And when you're driving a car, you certainly say, Oh my god, be careful, they may slip. Add to that slippery roads and night time too. Any of these reasons can be dangerous for transport. That does not mean that the scooter should not exist because scooters are an evolution of bicycles and it is all the path of prosperity.And this seemed like a dangerous form of transport. So, I, to be frank if I might go through the process, I asked myself, what if you put two wheels on the back that will give greater stability?

If you build a bar over the top could you save the occupant? I will stop there and come back. Last year, to my surprise I found that BMW had produced a scooter with the same bars that I had thought about with rubber bumpers on the side so that if they (the riders) fell they wouldn't hurt themselves and the seat there had a seatbelt. And I thought, that's exactly what I had thought about. The fact was that BMW had put this out though it was not successful and they had withdrawn it. But, someone else had also thought of the same thing. It had only two wheels not three. So, I set about thinking, can we make a four wheel vehicle from scooter parts initially and I, in fact, addressed an Automotive Component Manufacturers' Association (ACMA) meeting saying that can we all get together produce an Asian peoples' car.

To this I never got very much response. The idea was a really low cost car that Malaysia, Indonesia and India could come together to produce jointly. We could produce one part, they could produce another part, and each one would exchange and have the rights. In fact, even for the Indica, I went to ACMA. I said can we have an Indian car because no car has been designed in India. That time I was actually criticised. This time I had no response. So, in this particular case I had no response. In fact, the person who showed some encouragement was Brij Mohan Munjal, but we never really took it further.And then we found that scooter parts were probably a real limitation.

Because we thought that if we had to do something that was different, then we probably didn't want to have a legacy in any way or form and so we thought we should look at everything from scratch. And, initially I thought we could even have a car made from engineering plastics.But we found that several of these concepts do not lend themselves to either cost or volume manufacturing and have had to move away from that to a more conventional kind of car. So, that led us to configure a small car which would be not a three wheeler but four wheels.

It would be a car, a full-fledged car and we started again in an evolutionary manner and we thought, and if I might say so, it really started with being a four wheel rural car. Do we have rolled up plastic curtains instead of windows? Do we have openings like auto rickshaws have instead of doors or do we have a safety bar? As we went on, we had many early concepts that went that kind of way till we finally decided that the market does not want a half car. The market wants a car. And if we want to build a peoples' car, it should be a car and not something that people would say, Ah! That's just a scooter with four wheels or an auto rickshaw with four wheels or not really a car and I was reminded of a very interesting concept that Chrysler did many years ago when they developed an Asian car.

It was a plastic car and for those who may not know or remember, it was one piece, the whole car from front bumper to back bumper, moulded in one piece of plastic, half of it and the other half. And it was welded together to make the whole car.The most expensive part of any manufacturing unit is the paint shop. So this car with pigmentation with plastic parts, you didn't have to paint it, but no one liked the car because, in my view (I drove the car) it was very nice, but people wanted a real car and not something that someone would say was not a car, this is half-a-car or three-fourths of a car.

It has obviously been a long journey. It has been a longer journey than it should have been. I think we have easily taken two years or 18 months more than it should have been.Q: What were the most challenging moments to your mind? They all relate to costs. Perhaps the bigger, more visible issue is that somewhere we needed to benchmark ourselves against something. And we took the Maruti 800 as a benchmark. In terms of acceleration and driveability, it should at least equal the Maruti and in some areas it should exceed the Maruti. So, somewhere along the line we had to increase the size of the engine to give us the kind of performance which we have now and the rest have been issues, you know, relating to costs. It meant just doing the same thing again and again to bring the cost down, and where to put the fuel tank and all those kind of is-sues.Q: People are used to'),\n",

So how did you achieve breakthroughs in shaving off costs? We haven't changed when you see the car. It is a four-door car, five-seat, rear engine and in many ways conventionally constructed. What has been done is like (in the case of) door locks, we have the same lock on all four doors, both left hand and right hand. We have some parts that are wing locked from inside. To remove the engine you can work at from the top, it is in the rear. Probably when you see the car, we have really packaged it rather tightly and I think most of the benefit we got on cost was that we used less steel and we just made the car smaller outside yet big inside.Q: You think that this car is going to some way change the DNA of\"),\n",

That is not what it was conceived for. Well, the fact that you are doing it to address the market, that's huge. It gives you an expectation of, you know, if we produce 50,000 of such cars then we are ready to undertake that exercise. From the time we are thinking that we could follow on with this, could be different fuels can be produced, an electric version of the car can be produced or hybrid version of this car or can we make this car the platform for a new set of personal transport.

Do you think that is an elitist criticism? Yeah, I asked myself. We produced about 7 million two wheelers earlier. Today, we almost have about 60-70 million two to three wheelers in the country. We produced about 1.4 million cars and at some point we will exceed 2 million. Nobody said anything about that. It only happens to be this car that is being targeted.

You may say well OK the two wheeler takes lesser space. Our car pollutes if not less, then certainly not more than a two wheeler and I am not talking per passenger but as a vehicle. We conform to Euro IV in terms of our engine. Today Bharat III is required, we conform to Bharat III. All scooters and two wheelers are Bharat II today, not that they are not conforming, but that's what their standard is. So, all I want to say is that yes you may take a view that this small car will take less space than a large car. Yes, you may say that this car will carry four people instead of the normal two on a scooter and therefore you will have if, filled in with four people, you will have less on the road than two scooters.

More of immediate concern, for anyone that drives a car, is that today two or three wheelers have become a little more of a menace on the road than a car has become because of their ability to weave in and out. And it makes an assumption that a small car will not replace a bigger car. It just looks at it as an increment. You produce two million cars, you produce half-a-million Tata cars, you produce 2.5 million cars. That's not quite the way it is going to work. We will cannibalise some of the existing low-end cars or cannibalise some of the existing two wheelers. Some of the cannibalisation will be of our own product and Indica is also going to feel the effects of this.

He is not looking for a lot of creature comforts; he wants to get around in a sensible way. Then you think of a person who is perhaps thinking of or owns an existing small car.

I think the best way to answer that is to again go back in time. Maruti was the only manufacturer in the low-end car space. At that time, I felt that it needed to be challenged so we started on the small car in that space. I knew at that time the European manufacturers and the other Japanese manufacturers would never be able to produce a comfortable car. The Koreans could, and they did.

But then we realised that we were all coming out at the same time, and we had three offerings of the new price dimension and a more modern car than the Maruti. That probably added considerably to the growth of the car industry and it probably should have had the same reaction as this one is because it is exactly the same thing. Maruti was producing about 150,000 cars at that time. The 800 was the only one and I think by the time the Esteem had come, 180,000 cars or may be 200,000 cars were being produced.

What does it take for industrial corporations like Tata Motors to innovate in a knowledge era?I think the one thing that needs to happen is that challenges need to be given to the organisation.

In a way, this is my hypothesis: we have a history in India of being licensed manufacturers.

In either of those challenges, the real challenge is when you have some strength and you really choose to throw out the gauntlet that you can do X.

We would produce all the mass items and ship it to them as kits so its similar to an SKD or CKD operation. The assemblers would also be the dealers for the car and thus we would eliminate one level. First, I would like to do that in India and it will be very satisfying if the small car created 10 or 15 satellite groups of young engineers who thought they could get together and do a business, but which they would never be able to get, normally, like in the assembly of cars or be involved in an industry of that nature.

It was here that Tata first developed a passion for design—an inclination that would later influence some of his most iconic business ventures. He further honed his managerial acumen at Harvard Business School, completing the Advanced Management Program in 1975.A reluctant leader who transformed the Tata GroupRatan Tata’s early years at the Tata Group were characterised by a deliberate avoidance of any overt reliance on his family name. He began his career on the shop floor at Tata Steel, where he worked alongside blue-collar laborers, learning the business from the ground up. This humility and hands-on experience would define his approach to leadership in the years to come.When Tata assumed leadership of the Tata Group in 1991, he inherited an empire steeped in legacy but in need of reinvention. What followed was nothing\n",
